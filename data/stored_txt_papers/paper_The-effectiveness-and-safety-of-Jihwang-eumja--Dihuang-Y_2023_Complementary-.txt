Meta-analysis 
Systematic review ABSTRACT  
Background and purpose: Jihwang-eumja is reported to be effective in decreasing β-amyloid expression and 
activating monoamine oxidase and acetylcholinesterase in rat models. This systematic review aims to evaluate 
the effectiveness of Jihwang-eumja in Alzheimer ’s disease compared to Western medications. 
Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, CNKI, ScienceON, KISS, and Kmbase. Randomized 
controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of Jihwang-eumja and Western medications on the cognition and 
the activities of daily living in Alzheimer ’s disease were included. The results were synthesized using meta- 
analysis. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and the evidence level of each 
outcome was suggested using the GRADE system. 
Results: A total of 165 studies were screened, and six were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. A 
total of 245 and 240 participants were included in the intervention and comparison groups, respectively. The 
results showed that Mini-Mental State Examination was 3.19 (95%CI: 1.68 –4.70) higher, and the standardized 
mean difference of activities of daily living was 1.13 (95%CI: 0.89 –1.37) higher in the Jihwang-eumja group than 
in Western medications group. The included studies contained some concerns of the risk of bias, and the certainty 
of the evidence was considered moderate. 
Conclusion: Despite the small number of studies and high heterogeneity, we could verify the applicability of 
Jihwang-eumja for Alzheimer ’s disease.   
1.Introduction 
Dementia is a complicated neurocognitive syndrome characterized 
by severe impairment in memory, orientation, understanding, calcula -
tion, learning, language, and judgment. Dementia is usually diagnosed 
when symptoms are severe enough to disturb social activities and per-
sonal relationships [1]. 
Over 55 million people have dementia worldwide, and it is estimated 
to reach 78 million by 2030 [2]. The total economic costs caused by 
dementia were 279.6 billion dollars in 2000 and increased by 948 billion 
dollars in 2016, with an annual growth rate of 15.94% [3]. Thus, de-
mentia is considered one of the main burdens of an aging society. 
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), dementia is classified as a major neurocognitive dis-
order and its subtype is determined by its underlying etiology and cause. 
The most common subtype is Alzheimer ’s disease (AD), which accounts 
for approximately 63.6% of all dementia cases, including 42.0% of AD 
cases and 21.6% of cases of combined pathology of Alzheimer ’s disease 
and vascular dementia [4]. AD is characterized by progressive loss of 
synapses and neurons, accumulation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary 
tangles, and prominent cholinergic deficits. Additionally, the hippo -
campus and cerebral cortex atrophy occur at the microscopic level [5,6]. 
Currently, pharmacological treatment is only symptomatic and is 
unsatisfactory for permanently stabilizing the disease [6]. Acetylcho -
linesterase inhibitors are used to improve the cholinergic function, and 
N-methyl- D-aspartate antagonists are used to alleviate neuropsychiatric

2symptoms by decreasing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and neuro -
degeneration [6]. However, side effects have been reported in 15–78% 
of the cases, including gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, insomnia, 
agitation, confusion, and cardiac arrhythmia [7]. 
In traditional Korean medicine, various herbal medications have 
been studied for AD. In 2016 and 2020, systematic reviews revealed the 
potential effects of herbal medicines on cognition, the activities of daily 
living (ADL), and the behavioral and psychological symptoms of de-
mentia in patients with AD [8,9]. Nevertheless, these studies mainly 
included herbal medicines and single herb extracts, leading to difficult 
clinical applications in traditional Korean medicine. 
Jihwang-eumja is initially found in DSeongjechongnok F[10] and 
introduced in the ‘Wind ’ part of DDonguibogam, Miscellaneous disor -
ders 1F[11] that treats disabled legs and dysarthria caused by kidney 
insufficiency, rendering qi incapable of reaching under the tongue. Of 
these, renal insufficiency is considered the main pathogenesis of de-
mentia in Korean traditional medicine [12]. It was reported that 
Jihwang-eumja was more effective than donepezil in decreasing β-am-
yloid expression levels in rat brain tissue [13]. In addition, another study 
showed that Jihwang-eumja reduced the activation of monoamine oxi-
dase and acetylcholinesterase in a rat model [14]. 
To date, however, no clinical studies or systematic reviews have 
investigated the clinical effectiveness of Jihwang-eumja in patients with 
AD. Based on the medical classics and experimental evidence, a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in this study to verify 
the effectiveness and safety of Jihwang-eumja compared to Western 
medications in cognitive function and ADL in patients with AD. 
2.Methods 
This study was registered in Open Science Framework (OSF Regis -
tration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/HXA58), and the protocol of this sys-
tematic review was published in Medicine on May 14, 2021 (https://doi. 
org/10.1097/MD.0000000000025592 ). 
2.1. Search strategies 
The key clinical question was developed based on the participants, 
intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (PICOS) format. P 
is for patients with AD, I is for Jihwang-eumja, C is for Western medi -
cations, O is for cognitive function and ADL, and S is for randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs). Eight electronic databases were searched on 
November 30, 2021, without language restriction or date limits: Med-
line, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, CNKI, ScienceON, KISS, and Kmbase. 
For including grey literature, thesis papers were searched from CNKI and 
ScienceON. Search terms were composed using the controlled vocabu -
lary, based on the keywords ‘Alzheimer ’ for participants and ‘Jihwang- 
eumja ’ or ‘Dihuang Yinzi ’ for interventions (Appendix ). EndNote X7.8 
was used to save the search results and manage the literature throughout 
the study. 
2.2. Eligibility criteria 
Searched literature was assessed for eligibility for a systematic re-
view and meta-analysis according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
The eligibility criteria were organized by PICOS format. Two researchers 
(JYK and JYL) separately performed the selection process; they first 
screened the literature with the title and abstract and then cross-checked 
with each other. In case of disagreement, the full texts were reviewed by 
a third researcher (ICJ). 
2.2.1. Study design 
Only RCTs were included and non-randomized trials, cohort studies, 
case-control studies, case series, cross-sectional studies, case reports, 
reviews, and animal or cell research were excluded. 2.2.2. Participants 
Participants with major neurocognitive disorder and diagnosed with 
AD according to specific diagnostic criteria were included. No re-
strictions were imposed on age, sex, nationality, race, inpatient or 
outpatient, or medical history. 
2.2.3. Interventions 
The form of Jihwang-eumja was unlimited; various forms such as 
decoction, capsules, granules, and powder were included. Modified 
prescriptions were included if they contained the basic components of 
Jihwang-eumja (Rehmanniae Radix Preparata, Morindae Radix, Cornus 
officinalis Siebold et Zuccarini, Cistanche deserticola Y. C. Ma, Dendrobii 
Caulis, Polygalae Radix, Schisandra chinensis Baillon, Poria sclerotium, 
Liriope platyphylla Wang et Tang, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata, Cin-
namomi Cortex, Acorus gramineus Solander, Menthae Herba, Zingiberis 
Rhizoma Recens, and Zizyphi Fructus ) [15]. Combined interventions with 
Western medications, other herbal medicines, acupuncture, moxibus -
tion, and cognitive training were excluded. 
2.2.4. Comparisons 
Only the studies using Western medications as comparisons were 
included. The studies using a placebo, herbal medicines, acupuncture, or 
Jihwang-eumja combined with other herbal medicine or acupuncture as 
comparisons were excluded. 
2.2.5. Outcome measures 
2.2.5.1. Primary outcomes. The Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer ’s disease 
assessment scale –cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), and Hasegawa de-
mentia scale (HDS) were selected as the primary outcomes. 
2.2.5.2. Secondary outcomes. The ADL scale was selected for the 
assessment of the functions of daily living. Adverse events (AEs) and 
medical examinations for safety evaluations were recorded. However, 
the effective ratio was excluded because of inconsistent definitions in 
the literature. 
2.3. Data extraction 
The data of the included studies were independently extracted by 
two researchers (JYK and JYL). Study design, intervention, comparison, 
treatment duration, follow-up, outcome measures, results (mean, SD, 
and quartiles), and AEs were recorded in Excel. Among the various re-
ported outcomes, we extracted the data related to cognition and ADL. 
2.4. Risk of bias assessment 
The quality of the included RCTs was evaluated using the revised 
Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2.0) [16], which consists of five items:  
(1) bias arising from the randomization process  
(2) bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to 
missing outcome data  
(3) bias in the measurement of the outcome  
(4) bias in the selection of the reported result 
Two researchers (JYK and JYL) independently assessed the risk of 
bias, and the third researcher (ICJ) reviewed any conflicting opinions. 
2.5. Data synthesis and analysis 
Meta-analysis was conducted for the outcomes measured in at least 
two studies, using RevMan version 5.4 provided by the Cochrane 
Collaboration. Continuous data were presented as mean ±standard J.Y. Kim et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice 51 (2023) 101746
3deviation (SD) and quartiles. For the AEs, the relative risks were esti-
mated and synthesized. In the case of high heterogeneity between 
studies or synthesizing different outcome measures, the standardized 
mean difference (SMD) was adopted. A 95% confidence interval (CI) and 
p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The 
sample means and SD were estimated from the interquartile range ac-
cording to the method described by Wan et al. which provides improved 
estimation by incorporating the information of the sample size [17]. For 
the meta-analysis, a random effect model was applied if the number of 
studies was higher than five. A fixed-effect model was used when the 
number was equal to or smaller than five. The heterogeneity was dis-
cussed from both clinical and statistical perspectives. Statistical het-
erogeneity was evaluated as follows: low heterogeneity for I2D25%, 
moderate heterogeneity for I2 25% –75%, and high heterogeneity for 
I2F75%. We did not conduct a subgroup analysis due to the small 
number of included studies. 
2.6. GRADE assessment for clinical recommendations 
The evidence level across the included studies was assessed using the 
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evalua -
tion (GRADE) tool [18] for clinical recommendations. The evidence was 
suggested in a summary of findings table, and the risk of bias was 
evaluated at the outcome level in terms of inconsistency, indirectness, 
imprecision, publication bias into ‘not serious ’, ‘serious ’, and ‘very 
serious ’. The certainty of the evidence was classified as follows: ‘high ’, 
‘moderate ’, ‘low’, and ‘very low’. Two researchers (JYK and JYL) 
independently performed the GRADE assessment, and the third 
researcher (ICJ) arranged any conflicting decisions. 
3.Results 
3.1. Searched literature 
A total of 165 studies were identified from the eight databases.. After the duplicated records were removed (n 163), two researchers inde-
pendently screened the articles by title and abstract (n 12). After 
assessing full-text articles, one RCT that studied Jihwang-eumja as an 
add-on therapy, one RCT that measured only depressive symptoms, 
three case series, and one RCT that included participants with vascular 
dementia were excluded. Finally, six studies were included in this sys-
tematic review and quantitative synthesis (Fig. 1). 
3.2. Summary of the included studies 
The six included studies were RCTs published in China (Table 1). In 
Zhang (2006) [19], 56 participants were diagnosed with AD according 
to the DSM-IV and with the deficiency of kidney syndrome complicated 
with phlegm and blood stasis by pattern identification. Participants were 
randomly divided into Jihwang-eumja and pyritinol hydrochloride 
groups and were treated for 60 days. After the treatment, the MMSE (p 
D0.01), HDS (p D0.01), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) 
(p D0.01) were more improved in the Jihwang-eumja group than the 
pyritinol hydrochloride group. No significant differences in ADL were 
detected between both groups. 
In Jia et al. (2018) [20], 93 participants diagnosed with AD by im-
aging and clinical features were randomly administered with 
Jihwang-eumja decoction or donepezil for three months. 
Jihwang-eumja was more effective in enhancing HDS (p D0.05) and 
MMSE (p D0.05) than donepezil. 
In Zhang et al. (2018) [21], 60 participants with mild to moderate 
dementia were identified as AD by the National Institute of Neurological 
and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer ’s disease 
and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA). Participants were 
also assessed in terms of pattern identification. Eventually, the defi-
ciency of both yin and yang in kidney syndrome complicated with 
phlegm turbidity covering the orifices was included. To compare the 
effects of Jihwang-eumja granules and donepezil on cognition and daily 
living ability, MMSE, ADAS-cog, ADL, and the Clinician Interview-Based 
Impression of Change, plus caregiver interview (CIBIC-Plus) were

4evaluated. After three months, no differences were detected between the 
Jihwang-eumja and donepezil groups when comparing MMSE and 
ADAS-cog. In contrast, ADL improved more in the Jihwang-eumja group 
than in the donepezil group (p D0.05). 
In Wang (2017)[ 22], 76 participants with AD were randomly allo-
cated to two groups. The intervention group was prescribed 
Jihwang-eumja, and the comparison group was administered donepezil 
for one month. After treatment, Jihwang-eumja was found to be more 
effective in improving ADL (p D0.05), MMSE (p D0.05), and HDS (p D
0.05) than donepezil. 
In Ma (2019) [23], 150 participants who satisfied the World Health 
Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for AD were selected. After a 
random allocation process, participants were administered 
Jihwang-eumja with comprehensive nursing or donepezil with usual 
nursing for 2 months. At the end of the treatment, ADL (p D0.05), HDS 
(p D0.05), and MMSE (p D0.05) were significantly higher in the Jihwang-eumja group than in the donepezil group. 
In Zhang et al. (2019) [24], 50 participants diagnosed with AD ac-
cording to the DSM-5, were randomly divided into Jihwang-eumja and 
donepezil groups. Treatments were administered for three months. The 
results showed that Jihwang-eumja was more effective in improving the 
MMSE (p D0.01) and MoCA (p D0.01) than donepezil. No significant 
differences were detected in the ADL scores (p F0.05) between both 
groups. 
3.3. Participant characteristics 
The number of participants included in the quantitative synthesis 
was 245 and 240 in the intervention and comparison groups, respec -
tively. Three studies [19,21,24] limited the age, and two included 
severity restriction. Zhang (2006) [19] included participants over 50 
years old. Zhang et al. (2018) [21] selected participants aged 60–70 Table 1

5years with mild to moderate dementia who scored 10 to 24 on the 
MMSE, 1 to 2 on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and below 4 on the 
Hachinski score. In Zhang et al. (2019) [24], participants were aged 
between 60 and 85 years and scored 1 in CDR and below 4 in the 
Hachinski scale. Two studies [19,21] used the pattern identification 
method. Zhang (2006) [19] included participants with kidney syndrome 
complicated with phlegm and blood stasis. Zhang et al. (2018) [21] 
included only the deficiency of both yin and yang of kidney syndrome 
complicated with phlegm turbidity covering the orifices. 
3.4. Intervention 
The formula, ingredients, and dose of Jihwan-eumja used in the 
included studies are described in Table 2. Two studies [21,24] used 
granules, whereas others [19,20,22,23] used decoction of 
Jihwang-eumja. Two studies [23,24] modified the ingredients based on 
the clinical symptoms of the participants and did not report the modi -
fication. One study [24] did not report the herbal ingredients in detail. 
The treatment period varied from one to three months. Five studies 
[19–22,24] used Jihwang-eumja only, whereas Ma (2019) [23] com-
bined Jihwang-eumja with comprehensive nursing, which includes 
cognitive, psychological support, and patient education. 
3.5. Comparisons 
In all studies, the comparison group was treated with Western 
medications. Five RCTs [20–24] used donepezil, and one RCT [19] used 
pyritinol hydrochloride as the comparatives. Jia et al. (2018) [20] 
administered donepezil once a day to the comparison group, 5 mg 
during the first month, and 10 mg for the second and third months. 
Zhang et al. (2018) [21] provided 10 mg of donepezil per day. In studies 
by Wang (2017) [22], Ma (2019) [23], and Zhang et al. (2019) [24], 
participants were daily administered 5 mg of donepezil. In the study by 
Zhang (2006) [19], pyritinol hydrochloride (0.2 g) was administered 
three times a day to the comparison group. 
3.6. Outcome measures 
To evaluate cognitive function, MMSE and HDS were measured in six 
[19–24] and four [19,20,22,23] studies, respectively. ADAS-cog, 
CIBIC-Plus, and MoCA were used once. Five studies [19,21–24] 
assessed the level of daily activity. All studies used the ADL scale without 
describing the exact version, and one study [19] used the FAQ scale. 
For safety evaluation, five studies [19–23] investigated AEs 
including specific responses, and one study [24] did not report AEs. Two 
studies [19,21] performed laboratory tests. One study [21] compared 
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, alanine aminotrans -
ferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, creatinine, 
fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyc -
eride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels before and after treatment. One study [19] described 
that, according to the blood and urine tests, hepatic and renal function 
were not significantly changed during the trial. 
3.7. Risk of bias assessment 
Across all the possible biases according to ROB 2.0, the included 
studies contained some concerns of the risk of bias (Figs. 2 and 3). 
3.7.1. Bias arising from the randomization process 
The six studies showed some concerns of bias arising from the 
randomization process because the information about allocation 
concealment was absent in the paper. Table 2

63.7.2. Bias due to deviations from the intended interventions and bias due 
to missing outcome data 
In all studies, the participants were aware of the intervention owing 
to the difference in dosage form between Jihwang-eumja and Western 
medications. In five studies [20–24], without any drop-out or missing 
data throughout the trials, intention-to-treat analyses could be adopted 
in a ratio 1:1. This rendered these studies with a low risk of bias due to 
deviations from the intended interventions and missing outcome data. 
However, in Zhang (2006) [19], the number included for analyses in the 
intervention and comparison groups was 30 and 26 respectively, and the 
information about the random sequence generation and drop-outs were 
unavailable. As a result, the authors agreed that Zhang (2006) [19] had 
a high risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions and 
some concerns of bias due to missing outcome data. 
3.7.3. Bias in the measurement of the outcome 
Regarding the bias in the measurement of the outcome, none of the 
studies stated whether assessors were blinded. However, using objective 
measurement tools, all studies were thought to have a low risk of bias in 
the measurement of the outcome. 
3.7.4. Bias in the selection of the reported result 
All studies contained some concerns of selection bias because neither 
the trials were registered nor the protocols were available. 
3.8. Data synthesized by meta-analysis 
A total of six RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. 
3.8.1. Cognitive function 
The MMSE of six RCTs was synthesized for meta-analysis, and 485 
participants were included (Fig. 4). MMSE was 3.19 (95%CI: 1.68 –4.70) 
higher in the Jihwang-eumja group than in the Western medications 
group. Jihwang-eumja was more effective in improving cognitive 
function than the comparison group. The I2 was 92%, and the hetero -
geneity among the studies was considered high. 
HDS was evaluated in four RCTs [19,20,22,23], and 375 participants 
were included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 5). Jihwang-eumja was more 
effective in improving the HDS by 5.90 (95%CI: 5.44 –6.37) than the 
Western medications group. The heterogeneity across the studies was 
high, with a 95% I2. 
3.8.2. Activities of daily living 
Four studies were selected for the meta-analysis of ADL, and a total of 110 participants were included (Fig. 6). Zhang et al. (2019) [24] also 
reported ADL; however, since neither the exact version of the ADL tool 
nor the score indicating better daily activity functions was described, it 
was excluded from the meta-analysis. Because none of the included 
studies reported the version of the ADL tool, the SMD was applied. The 
SMD of ADL was 1.13 (95%CI: 0.89 –1.37) higher in the Jihwang-eumja 
group than in the Western medications group. I2 was 95%, and the 
studies had high heterogeneity. 
3.8.3. Safety assessment 
Four studies that reported AEs were included for quantitative syn-
thesis for safety assessment, and 379 participants were included (Fig. 7). 
The relative risk of AEs was 0.39-fold (95%CI: 0.20 –0.78) in the 
Jihwang-eumja group compared to the Western medications group. The 
included studies showed moderate heterogeneity, with an I2 value of 
54%. Table 2 (continued )

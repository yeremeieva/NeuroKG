Nutrition ABSTRACT  
Background and aims: Several studies have been performed in vitro and in animals showing that propolis (a resin 
made by bees) has excellent anti-inflammatory properties, but no study has been performed in patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD). The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of propolis 
supplementation on inflammatory markers in patients with CKD on HD. 
Methods: This is a longitudinal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with patients randomized into two groups: 
propolis (4 capsules of 100 mg/day containing concentrated and standardized dry EPP-AF ® green propolis 
extract) or placebo (4 capsules of 100 mg/day containing microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and 
colloidal silicon dioxide) for two months. Routine parameters were analyzed using commercial kits. The plasma 
levels of inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by flow luminometry. 
Results: Forty-one patients completed the follow-up, 21 patients in the propolis group (45 ±12 years, 13 women, 
BMI, 22.8 ±3.7 kg/m2) and 20 in the placebo group (45.5 ±14 years, 13 women, BMI, 24.8 ±6.8 kg/m2). The 
obtained data revealed that the intervention with propolis significantly reduced the serum levels of tumour 
necrosis factor α (TNF α) (p 0.009) as well as had the tendency to reduce the levels of macrophage inflam -
matory protein-1 β (MIP-1 β) (p 0.07). There were no significant differences in the placebo group. 
Conclusion: Short-term EPP-AF ® propolis dry extract 400 mg/day supplementation seems to mitigate inflam -
mation, reducing the plasma levels of TNFα and MIP-1 β in patients with CKD on HD. This study was registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04411758).   
1.Introduction 
Despite recent advances in dialysis solute and membrane technology, 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis 
(HD) have several risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is the leading cause of mortality in these patients [1,2]. In addition to 
traditional risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) 
and typical situations of kidney disease (such as hypervolemia, anaemia 
and changes in calcium-phosphorus metabolism), patients on renal 
replacement therapy also have a high prevalence of emerging factors,

2such as oxidative stress and inflammation [2–5]. 
These patients have a high production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and a reduction in the functioning of the body ’s antioxidant 
system. Oxidative stress is directly linked to inflammation since ROS 
promote the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF- κB), a transcription 
factor responsible for the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines such as 
interleukins IL-1, IL-6, IL8, IL-1β, IL-18, tumour necrosis factor α (TNF- 
α), interferon- γ (INF- γ) and other molecules such as vascular cell 
adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
(ICAM-1), which are closely associated with the progression of CVD, 
including acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure [6,7]. 
ROS also reduce the antioxidant capacity, caused mainly by impaired 
activation of factor 2-related erythroid nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2), one of the 
main cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress [8,9]. 
Therapeutic approaches to mitigate inflammation and oxidative 
stress are studied in patients with CKD, and nutritional interventions 
using food as medicine have been adopted for these patients [10]. 
Propolis, a resinous substance produced by bees from different plant 
exudates, has been used since ancient times for medicinal purposes and, 
currently, research has confirmed its biological effects, including anti-
cancer, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory 
activities reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
[11–14]. 
It is important to know that the chemical composition of propolis 
depends on the flora of the region where it comes from [15,16]. So, the 
propolis substances have a variable composition. The combination of its 
various chemical components determines its broad biological activity, 
such as pinocembrin, acacetin, chrysin, rutin, luteolin, kaempferol, 
apigenin, myricetin, catechin, naringenin, galangin and quercetin, caf-
feic, cinnamic and ferulic acids, prenylated phenylpropanids, and 
several others compounds including vitamins and minerals [11,12,17]. 
Some standardized extracts were already proposed offer batch-to- 
batch reproducible chemical profiles, such as Brazilian propolis stan-
dardized extracts EPP-AF ® [18], which was already studied under the 
safety and efficacy point of view in several models, including human 
clinical trials [17,19–24]. 
There are no studies on the role of propolis in patients with CKD on 
HD. Only one study performed in non-dialysis CKD patients showed that 
supplementation of 500 mg/day of green propolis extract for 12 months 
reduced urinary MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and 
proteinuria in these patients [21]. Considering the vital safety and ef-
ficacy background of propolis extract, it could be proposed as an option 
to be studied focused on the benefit of patients with CKD and reducing 
its inflammatory process. 
Thus, the possible effects of propolis in patients with CKD were 
discussed in a narrative review. It was concluded that this resin made by 
bees could attenuate inflammation in these patients [25]. Also, a recent 
systematic review showed that propolis might reduce oxidative stress 
and renal damage, including inflammation status [26]. 
The hypothesis proposed in this study is that propolis supplemen -
tation could reduce the inflammatory markers in patients with CKD 
undergoing HD. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of 
propolis dry extract supplementation on inflammation in patients un-
dergoing HD and its safety. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Propolis extraction and analysis 
The green propolis standardized extract was kindly provided by Apis 
Flora Co. (Ribeir ~ao Preto, S~ao Paulo, Brazil). Propolis glycolic extract 
(PGE) was obtained from EPP-AF ® after evaporation of the ethanol 
portion and to achieve 30% w/v of dry matter. The analysis was pre-
viously described by Sousa et al. (2007) [27]. The propolis extracts were 
analyzed by HPLC [18]. Table 1 shows the chemical characteristics of 
the propolis extract used. The total flavonoid as quercetin and the total phenolic as gallic acid were analyzed according to the method described 
above [18]. 
2.2. Patients 
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 
41 hemodialysis patients was carried out from January to March 2021. 
Sample size calculation was performed a priori using G-Power 3.1 
software for comparison of means between two groups (differences be-
tween post-intervention and baseline collections for placebo and prop-
olis groups) by T-test. We assumed statistical power of 80%, a two-tailed 
significance level of 5%, an effect size (differences between groups) of 1, 
and a sample ratio between groups of 1, resulting in the desired sample 
size of 17 individuals per group. The primary endpoint was the TNF- α 
serum level. 
The research was carried out after each participant signed the free 
and informed consent form, under the norms of the local Research Ethics 
Committees, based on the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the World Medical Association on research with human subjects. This 
study has been approved by the local ethics committee, and it is regis-
tered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04411758). 
2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Men and women with CKD on HD for at least six months, aged be-
tween 18 and 75 years, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access, 
and patients with individualized dietary prescription (adequate energy 
supply 25–35 Kcal/ideal Kg/day and protein from 1.0 to 1.2 g/ideal Kg/ 
day according to recommended by NKF-KDOQI, 2020) were included in 
the study. The HD sessions ranged from 3 to 4.5 h and occurred 3x/ 
week, with a dialysate flow of 500 mL/min and a blood flow greater than 
250 mL/min. Patients with autoimmune and infectious diseases, dia-
betes, cancer, and AIDS; pregnant, those using catabolic drugs, antibi -
otics, or antioxidant vitamin supplements (except for vitamin C, which is 
commonly used in the clinic), with regular intake of propolis and those 
who report being allergic to a bee sting, were excluded. Patients who 
had Covid-19 during the intervention period were also excluded. 
2.4. Study design 
In this clinical trial, patients were divided into two groups, the 
propolis group, in which CKD patients on HD received capsules con-
taining standardized, concentrated and dry extract of dry green propolis 
and the placebo group, in which the patients received capsules con-
taining microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and colloidal 
silicon dioxide. All the pots with the capsules were coded as A or B since 
it was a double-blind trial. 
The dosage was two capsules of 100 mg after lunch and two after 
dinner for two months, totaling 400 mg per day of propolis. 
The randomization of the groups was performed by an external 
person after checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible pa-
tients were ranked 1:1 according to a computer-generated list of treat-
ment codes. Blood tests, assessment of dietary intake, and 
anthropometric measurements were performed before and after the 
supplementation period with green propolis extract or placebo. 
Regarding the adherence to the propolis supplementation, our staff 
verified through telephone contact, message by text, or by the app Table 1

3WhatsApp ® whether patients were taking the capsules as directed. At 
the end of the two months of supplementation, we calculated the 
remaining capsules in the bottles. With the difference between the 
capsules offered for two months of treatment and the capsules left over 
at the end, it was possible to establish the percentage of adherence of 
each patient by multiplying the number of capsules remaining by 100. 
The assessment of nutritional status was carried out from the 
collection of anthropometric data obtained from the patient ’s medical 
records to minimize direct contact with patients as a result of the Covid- 
19 pandemic. It was used the dry weight (post HD) of the day on which 
the patients ’ blood samples were collected, and the same was used to 
calculate the BMI. Information on body weight and height was collected 
from the patient ’s medical records. A 3-day food recall assessed food 
intake. 
2.5. Primary and secondary outcomes 
The primary outcome was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects 
of propolis, and the secondary outcome was the safety of propolis 
evaluated by biochemical parameters and also by an adverse events 
questionnaire used in the study of Silveira et al. (2019) [21]. 
2.6. Collection and analysis of biological material 
Blood samples were obtained in the morning from the arterial side of 
the hemodialysis access prior to the dialysis session. Blood was collected 
in Vacutainer ® tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(EDTA) as the anticoagulant (1.0 mg/mL). To obtain the plasma and 
serum, the blood was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 •C and 
then stored at  80 •C until further analysis. 
2.7. Multiplex test (serum) – inflammation markers 
According to the manufacturer ’s recommendation, a multiplex bead- 
based assay was performed by the commercial kit and apparatus Bio- 
Plex Magpix (Biorad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, California, USA). The 
xMAP magnetic technology is based on microspheres that allow the 
detection of several different circulating proteins in the sample. In this 
study, serum levels of the following cytokines were analyzed: monocyte 
chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL-2); macrophage inflammatory pro-
tein-1 β (MIP-1 β/CCL-4); interleukin-2, -6, -7, -8 (CXCL8),  10 e  17; 
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α). 
2.8. Routine parameters 
Plasma levels of biochemical parameters (albumin, glucose, total 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, phosphorus, 
potassium, parathyroid hormone, hematocrit, and haemoglobin were 
analyzed using commercial kits from BioClin ®. 
2.9. Statistical analysis 
Non-parametric Mann –Whitney U tests were used to compare 
continuous numerical baseline demographic and clinical variables, 
whereas Fisher ’s exact tests were used for categorical variables. The 
cytokine plasma levels were log (base 10) transformed and used as 
outcome parameters. Multiple linear mixed-effects models were used to 
evaluate the time-intervention interactions, where patients were 
considered a random effect. The model ’s fixed systematic component 
was adjusted by confounding variables (i.e., time on HD and BMI). The 
mean and 95% confidence intervals were used, and the results were also 
presented graphically for the estimated mean marginal effects. The 
sample distributions of data are represented in box plots (strip plots in 
grey and the black horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence in-
tervals of the expected mean marginal effects by the group). The whole 
other variables made in the multiple linear mixed models remained in equal proportions or their average values, and contrasts were con-
structed from these estimated mean marginal effects. The Tukey Honest 
Significant Difference (HSD) method was used to correct p-values by the 
number of comparisons. It was considered statically significant p values 
≼0.05. R software version 4.1.1, packages ‘lme4 ’, ‘emmeans ’, and their 
dependencies were used to perform the statistical analyses. 
3.Results 
Forty-two patients completed the two months of intervention 
described in the CONSORT flow diagram (Fig. 1). The general charac -
teristics of the patients studied are shown in Table 2, and no difference 
was observed between the groups at the baseline. Only two patients 
presented BMI below 18.5 kg/m2 and five presented above 30 kg/m2. 
Regarding medication, 100% of all patients used antihypertensive 
drugs. The classes of antihypertensive drugs in descending order were: 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (58%), beta-blockers (41%), diuretics 
(33%), vasodilators (33%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(16%) and calcium channel blockers (8%). Regarding the food intake, 
patients presented a protein intake of 0.93 g/kg/day and 23.6 kcal/kg/ 
day. 
The baseline biochemical parameters are presented in Table 3, and 
there are no statically differences between the groups at baseline. Ac-
cording to albumin, 28% presented values below the recommendation 
(F3.8 g/dL). Around 50% presented hyperphosphatemia (F5.5 mg/dL), 
33% had high potassium levels (F5.5 mg/dL) and all patients presented 
anaemia according to haemoglobin values. Also, there is no evidence of 
plasma level differences after two months of intervention in both groups 
(data not shown). The values of dialysis adequacy (Kt/V) were in the 
adequate average and did not change after interventions. Additionally, 
to the biochemical analysis, the safety of supplementation was guaran -
teed, as there were no reports of adverse events that compromised the 
health of patients according to the questionnaire applied. 
Table 4 shows the cytokine levels (expressed in Log 10) before and 
after each intervention. Fig. 2 illustrates the cytokine plasma levels of 
both treatment groups, comparing before and after the intervention of 
each group. After two months of supplementation, the inflammation 
parameters showed a significant reduction in the TNF- α and a tendency 
to reduce the MIP-1 β serum levels in the propolis group. 
4.Discussion 
In this study, we show that supplementation with 400 mg of propolis 
per day for two months reduced the serum levels of TNFα and MIP-1 β. To 
our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating propolis ’s anti- 
inflammatory activities in patients undergoing hemodialysis. 
The main components of propolis are flavonoids and phenolic acids 
such as galangin and pinocembrin, well-known for their antioxidant 
action, with the ability to scavenge free radicals (donating hydrogen 
ions), neutralizing their action on cell membrane peroxidation and 
concomitantly apoptosis [28–30]. 
In the case of green propolis, prenylated cinnamic acid derivatives 
such as artepellin C, baccharin and drupanin are the key biomarkers and 
also participate in the biological activities of this product [17,31,32]. 
Artepellin C was demonstrated to control inflammation by down -
regulating the mediators as NF-kB and reducing the inflammation 
symptoms such as pain, oedema and redness [33,34]. Artepellin C also 
decreased the synthesis of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN- γ and other in-
flammatory cytokines [33–39], besides the increase of IL-10 37. 
Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of propolis on NF-kB expression 
have already been elucidated in the literature [26,40–42]. Pinocembrin 
binds at the site of action and prevents the nuclear translocation of 
NF-kB to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting its activation [43]. Other 
bioactive compounds found in propolis, like caffeic acid phenethyl ester 
(CAPE), have a direct role in the inhibition of mRNA expression of 
NF-kB, responsible for the synthesis of several pro-inflammatory T.R. Chermut et al.

4cytokines with IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, INF- γ, and TNFα [7,44,45]. Indeed, 
propolis can inhibit the synthesis of inflammatory markers such as 
C-reactive protein, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β [35]. 
Propolis efficiently reduced serum levels of TNFα by neutralizing 
ROS and activating the signaling pathway for its transcription in cuta-
neous anthrax animal models [46]. During the inflammatory process, 
TNFα also modulates the migration of neutrophils by stimulating endothelial cells to increase the expression of adhesion molecules, which 
are directly linked to adhesion, rolling, and transmigration of neutro -
phils [47]. Therefore, a possible way propolis modulates neutrophil

5chemotaxis during the inflammatory process is through the inactivation 
of TNFα, which leads to a decrease in the activation and migration of 
neutrophils. It also acts via the CXCL2/MIP-2 chemokine, which, when 
activated, connects to its CXCR2 chemokine receptor and stimulates the 
influx of calcium into neutrophils, activating them. It was seen that 
propolis acts by blocking this influx of calcium and decreases the acti-
vation and migration of neutrophils [48]. 
MIP-1 β is an important chemokine; among its functions, it is high-
lighted its role in the recruitment of leukocytes to the sites of infection, 
and in certain situations, it also acts by activating these cells [49]. In a 
study carried out in a cellular model, Szliszka et al. (2013) analyzed the 
action of Artepillin C isolated on macrophages, which suppressed the 
expression of MIP-1 β and also inhibited the synthesis of several in-
flammatory cytokines. The same author also tested different concen -
trations of green propolis ethanol extract that also showed an inhibitory 
effect on MIP-1 β, confirming the anti-inflammatory effects of propolis 
[50]. 
Still, on the immunomodulatory effect of propolis and its relation -
ship with the inflammatory system, the study of Conte et al. (2021) 
performed in a cell model explains that propolis from southeastern 
Brazil reduced the TNFα concentrations by inhibiting the production of 
Th cytokines and reduced IL-6 concentrations by inhibiting the stimu -
lation of retinoic acid in the production of this cytokine. In addition, 
propolis reduced NF-kB expression and increased IL-10 concentrations. 
These results are justified by propolis suppressing TLR-2 function (an 
important defense mechanism against pathogens) [41]. Machado et al. 
(2012) demonstrated that propolis increased IL-10 while reducing the 
inflammatory cytokines TNF- α and IL-6, proposing that the 
anti-inflammatory action is due to the immune regulation effects [37]. Furthermore, experimental and in vitro studies suggest that propolis 
restrains the production of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and the enzyme 
prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase and blocks COX-1 and COX-2 
activation and regulates signaling pathways and modulation of B and 
T lymphocyte cell function [51–54]. 
As previously mentioned, galangin is another flavonoid present in 
propolis with an important anti-inflammatory function. Chaihongsa 
et al. (2021) showed that this flavonoid reduced blood pressure and 
improved the capacity of endothelium-related vasodilation in rats with 
induced hypertension. In addition, when analyzing the effects on the 
inflammatory system, suppression of TNF-R1, NF-kB, and VCAM-1 was 
seen in the aorta tissue, and TNFα serum levels reduced [55]. They also 
showed reduced damage caused by oxidative stress in a systemic way 
and in the vessel itself. This result was explained by the fact that gal-
angin reduces the production of vascular O2, thus having a lower reac-
tion of O2 with NO2, which would produce more free radicals and 
consequently greater production of ROS [55]. 
Martin et al. (2021) observed a reduction in TNFα concentrations in 
patients with atopic dermatitis after the treatment with a cream con-
taining green propolis extract (34–120 ng/mL) for 60 days [56]. 
Regarding the effects of propolis on oxidative stress, a study carried 
out with 67 subjects who had at least one altered parameter (fasting 
glycemia, lipids profile and blood pressure, or diabetes mellitus, car-
diovascular disease, and/or overweight), where they received supple -
mentation of 15 drops of propolis (3% solution preparation in propylene 
glycol) twice daily for 90 days showed a reduction in serum levels of 
TBARS, which was not seen in the placebo group [57]. 
A clinical trial with healthy volunteers showed that after seven days 
of using EPP-AF ® (375 and 750 mg/day), the urinary excretion of 8- 
Fig. 2.Cytokines serum levels in both groups before and after each intervention. We found no evidence of interleukins serum levels differences after two 
months of intervention in both groups for interleukins-2, -6, -7, -8 (CXCL8),  10,  17 (A - F), nor for MCP-1 serum levels (G). However, we found significant 
differences for TNFα (H) and the tendency to reduce MIP-1 β (I) after two months of intervention in the propolis group. T.R. Chermut et al.

6isoprostanes (correlated with lipid peroxidation) and 8-OHDG (an 
important marker of oxidative DNA damage) was reduced [22]. 
Experimental studies (rats and rabbits) have shown that propolis 
supplementation reduces oxidative stress markers and increases the 
antioxidant enzymes [42,58]. 
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, much has been discussed about the 
role of propolis in this condition. In a recent clinical trial, Silveira et al. 
(2021) obtained clinically relevant results using propolis EPP-AF ® 
extract at a dosage of 400 mg or 800 mg for seven days in hospitalized 
patients with COVID-19. The main results of this trial demonstrated 
shorter hospital stay in the supplemented groups, reduced administra -
tion of vasoactive drugs, and most importantly, a lower incidence of 
acute kidney injury, with the higher dose group having a significantly 
lower rate of acute kidney injury than the control group. Acute kidney 
injury is a frequent complication in patients with COVID-19 and is 
associated with a worse prognosis, extended hospital stays, and lethality 
[23]. The authors of this study did not specify the mechanism of action 
of propolis in COVID-19. However, in the review publication of Berretta 
et al. (2020), several proposals that justify the propolis effects on 
covid-19 patients are presented, as the activities of some biomarkers in 
this process [24]. In addition, another propolis component, kaempferol, 
inhibits the expression of TMPRSS2 and reduces the anchoring of ACE2, 
which the virus needs to invade host cells. All these actions are relevant 
in combating the evolution of patients infected with SARS-COV [23]. 
4.1. Limitations 
It is known that propolis differs in composition according to each 
region of the country in which it is produced. Thus, one of the limitations 
is the region chosen in this study [15,16,32], where the number of total 
flavonoid compounds may have been lower than in the other studies 
used. However, advantageously green propolis possesses a prenylated 
group of compounds exclusively from Baccharis dracunculifolia exudates. 
Additionally, the propolis extract was standardized and patented to 
avoid the common variations observed with propolis. Another limitation 
to be considered is the supplementation time. Longer could be more 
effective. The third limitation is the dosage of propolis extract, and a 
high dose may promote a better anti-inflammatory effect. Regarding the 
safety of propolis, we cannot generalize these results; however, we 
showed that the dose and time of the propolis intervention were safe in 
this study. 
5.Conclusions 
Our results demonstrated that supplementation with propolis (400 
mg/day) for two months reduced inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα 
and MIP-1 β in patients with CKD on HD. However, the exact mechanism 
of action involved in regulating propolis and inflammatory pathway in 
these patients warrants further investigation. 
Practical application 
Nutritional interventions, including products rich in bioactive com-
pounds such as propolis, have modulated inflammatory status in chronic 
diseases, including CKD. This study evaluated if propolis, a well-known 
possible resource to act in the immune system and inflammation in 
general, could also modulate inflammation and oxidative stress in he-
modialysis patients. We showed that more studies are needed to eval-
uate such actions.

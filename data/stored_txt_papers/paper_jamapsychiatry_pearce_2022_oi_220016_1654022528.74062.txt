IMPORTANCE
Depression is the leading cause of mental health–related disease burden and
may be reduced by physical activity, but the dose-response relationship between activity anddepression is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze the dose-response association
between physical activity and incident depression from published prospective studies ofadults.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the reference lists of
systematic reviews retrieved by a systematic search up to December 11, 2020, with nolanguage limits. The date of the search was November 12, 2020.
STUDY SELECTION We included prospective cohort studies reporting physical activity at 3 or
more exposure levels and risk estimates for depression with 3000 or more adults and 3 yearsor longer of follow-up.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction was completed independently by 2
extractors and cross-checked for errors. A 2-stage random-effects dose-responsemeta-analysis was used to synthesize data. Study-specific associations were estimated usinggeneralized least-squares regression and the pooled association was estimated by combiningthe study-specific coefficients using restricted maximum likelihood.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome of interest was depression, including (1)
presence of major depressive disorder indicated by self-report of physician diagnosis, registrydata, or diagnostic interviews and (2) elevated depressive symptoms established usingvalidated cutoffs for a depressive screening instrument.
RESULTS Fifteen studies comprising 191 130 participants and 2 110 588 person-years were
included. An inverse curvilinear dose-response association between physical activity anddepression was observed, with steeper association gradients at lower activity volumes;heterogeneity was large and significant ( I
2= 74%; P< .001). Relative to adults not reporting
any activity, those accumulating half the recommended volume of physical activity (4.4marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week [mMET-h/wk]) had 18% (95% CI,13%-23%) lower risk of depression. Adults accumulating the recommended volume of 8.8mMET hours per week had 25% (95% CI, 18%-32%) lower risk with diminishing potentialbenefits and higher uncertainty observed beyond that exposure level. There werediminishing additional potential benefits and greater uncertainty at higher volumes ofphysical activity. Based on an estimate of exposure prevalences among included cohorts, ifless active adults had achieved the current physical activity recommendations, 11.5% (95% CI,7.7%-15.4%) of depression cases could have been prevented.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This systematic review and meta-analysis of associations
between physical activity and depression suggests significant mental health benefits frombeing physically active, even at levels below the public health recommendations. Healthpractitioners should therefore encourage any increase in physical activity to improve mentalhealth.

Question What is the dose-response association between
physical activity and incident depression in adults?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 15
prospective studies including more than 2 million person-yearsshowed an inverse curvilinear association between physicalactivity and incident depression, with greater differences in risk atlower exposure levels. Adults meeting physical activityrecommendations (equivalent to 2.5 h/wk of brisk walking) hadlower risk of depression, compared with adults reporting nophysical activity.
Meaning In this study, relatively small doses of physical activity
were associated with substantially lower risks of depression.Association Between Physical Activity and Risk of Depression Original Investigation Research

Frequency, Duration, and Intensity Assumptions
Studies that described physical activity exposure as fre-
quencyanddurationwereconvertedtoameasureofweeklyduration.Ifsessiondurationwasnotprovided,asessiondu-rationof0.75hourswasassumed.WeeklydurationswerethenconvertedtoactivityvolumeinmMEThoursperweekbymul-tiplying by intensity values of 1.5 mMET for light, 3.5 mMETformoderateandmoderatetovigorous,and7.0mMETforvig-orousphysicalactivity.

Converting Energy Expenditure to MET Units
One study reported energy expenditure without adjustment
forbodyweight(kcal/wk).Weightwascalculatedusingbodymassindexandheightfromnationalsurveydata.
13Theexpo-
sureinkcalperweekwasthendividedbyderivedweightandfurtherconvertedtoMEThoursusing1kcal/kg = 1METhour.
Removing the Resting Energy Expenditure Component
of Physical Activity
Forstudiesreportingphysicalactivityvolumeandcorrespond-
ing duration data, 1 MET hour per week was subtracted foreach hour of activity undertaken; this is equivalent to theoriginal studies having multiplied activity duration with net(mMET)ratherthangross(MET)intensityvalues.Ifdurationfor each volume level was not reported or obtainable fromauthors, we used a prediction equation derived from studieswherebothvolumeanddurationwereavailable(eMethods3in theSupplement ).
Removing Occupational Component of Aggregate
Physical Activity Estimates
Nonoccupational physical activity was used as the exposure

leisure-time, domestic, occupational, and transport do-mains. Given no domain-specific activity results were avail-ableforthisstudy,weassumedoccupationalactivitytobe40hours per week at 1.25 METs (or 0.25 mMETs, ie, equivalent
to sedentary office work) and estimated nonoccupationalphysical activity by subtracting this assumed occupationalvolume.
Analyses
We conducted dose-response meta-analyses for outcomeswith at least 4 independent studies available. For studiesreporting only sex-stratified results, strata-specific risks werecombined using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Sex-stratifiedmeta-analyses were not conducted because only 2 sets ofsex-stratifiedresultswereavailable.

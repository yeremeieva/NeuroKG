A rising number of patient cases point to a probable link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Parkinson ’s disease (PD), yet the
mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the brain and generates neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients remain
unknown. Ferroptosis, a distinct iron-dependent non-apoptotic type of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and
glutathione depletion, a key factor in neurological disorders. Ferroptosis may have a pathogenic role in COVID-19, according torecent ﬁndings, however its potential contributions to COVID-19-related PD have not yet been investigated. This review covers
potential paths for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brain. Among these putative processes, ferroptosis may contribute to the etiology of
COVID-19-associated PD, potentially providing therapeutic methods.

INTRODUCTION
Global anxiety and an economic catastrophe have been brought on
by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)epidemic, often known as the 2019 n ew coronavirus disease (COVID-
19) pandemic [ 1]. As of 17 December 2023, there have been 772
million con ﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, including 6.9 million
deaths, reported to the World Health Organization [ 2]. The impact of
COVID-19 has been unsurpassed thus far, and its long-term effects
might be far more disastrous [ 3,4]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which
causes the current COVID-19 pandemic, affects more than just therespiratory system, it also affects other organs and tissues [ 5]. SARS-
CoV-2 has recently been discovered in neurons in several parts of the
brain, including substantia nigra [ 6,7]. Several individuals with SARS-
CoV-2 infections have reported experiencing acute and subacuteneurological complications [ 8–10]. Due to a number of causes that
cause a reduction in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantianigra followed by striatal dopamine depletion, patients with
Parkinson ’s disease (PD) have a varie ty of motor and non-motor
impairments [ 11]. In this review, we explore current evidence
indicating a potential pathogenic links between COVID-19 and PD,
and provide directions for potential therapeutic approaches thattarget ferroptosis.
COVID-19 AND PD: A MORE DEFINED PICTURE
While the speci ﬁc mechanism causing the presumable degrada-
tion of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons after a viral infection is
still unknown, viral infection is receiving more and more attention
as a cause of PD [ 12,13]. Studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2
can in ﬁltrate the central nervous system (CNS) and cause
additional neurological dysfunction in a considerable percentage
of infected patients [ 9,14].
36% of SARS-CoV-2 infections experience neurological symp-
toms during the acute stage, 25% of which may be linked to CNS
involvement directly [ 15]. The substantia nigra are particularly
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [ 16]. Not all neuronal populations are
equally prone to degeneration. Due to their intrinsic characteristics,such as high energy needs to support heightened basal oxidative
phosphorylation in the mitochondria, high axon terminal density,
and substantial axonal arborization, dopaminergic neurons areparticularly susceptible to degeneration. Interestingly, at least 20
cases show that COVID-19 patients experienced clinical parkinson-
ism following SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 17], pointing to a potential link
between COVID-19 infection and newly formed parkinsonism.
COVID-19 NEUROTROPISM AND PD: EXPLORING THE LINKS
The CNS has been disrupted by COVID-19 in a variety of ways,including direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion of neuronal cells, huge

ﬂowing into brains, respiratory failure linked brain ischemia,
etc [ 18–20].
Olfactory bulb
Up to 20% of adults with COVID-19 infected individuals exhibit
anosmia/hyposmia and ageusia, which is a neurological symptom,
at an early stage of the viral illness [ 21]. Anosmia, however, is a
well-known precursor signal for PD development [ 22]. Further-
more, studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter directly
through the olfactory neurons and, intriguingly, without ﬁrst
affecting the lungs [ 23]. Impaired neurogenesis in the olfactory
system may bing on the anosmia in COVID-19 and PD [ 24]. SARS-
CoV-2 may have direct access to brain areas for the development
of PD, according to neuropathological investigations utilizing
immunostaining of α-synuclein aggregates that imply that PD
starts in either the olfactory or intestinal neurons and progresses
to the brain. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain by the
olfactory pathways and spread to the basal ganglia, brainstem,and piriform and infralimbic cortex [ 25].
Gut microbiome and gut physiology
A systemic in ﬂammatory state that SARS-CoV-2 induces may
enhance the risk for PD in addition to the direct invasion of theCNS [ 26]. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also brought on by
COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in the feces of
infected individuals, suggesting that the virus is intestinal in origin.According to a recent study [ 25], enterocytes are the main target
cells of SARS-CoV-2 and they respond to the infection by
triggering a powerful in ﬂammatory response. These results could
emphasize COVID-19 ’s possible function as a PD risk factor even
more [ 27].
Another idea contends that the gut microbiota is the starting
point of the in ﬂammatory process that results in PD [ 28].
Surprisingly, the neurological symptoms and gut microbiotachanges seen in patients of COVID-19 are also frequently present
in patients of PD [ 29]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infection
may change gut physiology in general and gut microbiota [ 30],
impacting all aspects that “peripherally ”contribute to the etiology
and development of PD [ 31].
Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
One of the major receptors that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2
into human cells, is the ACE2 receptor [ 32,33]. After infection,
COVID-19 has a greater af ﬁnity for protein S, which allows the viral
glycoprotein to attach to host cells ACE2 [ 34–36]. These receptors
are widely distributed on neurons and glial cells of many brain
areas, including cerebral cortex, striatum, substantia nigra, and
brain stem [
37]. In dopaminergic neurons, which are diminished in
PD patients, ACE2 is signi ﬁcantly expressed and may contribute to
the aggravation of pre-existing symptoms or a more severe
COVID-19 infection [ 38]. Due to ACE2 and DOPA decarboxylase co-
express and co-regulate in non-neuronal cell types, the dopaminesynthesis route may be implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-
19 [ 39,40]. ACE2 expression is downregulated by SARS-CoV
infection, which may contribute to the impairment of dopamineproduction [ 41–43]. There is evidence that the expression levels of
ACE2 in brains of PD patients have reduced, causing dopaminergic
neuron loss and degeneration [ 44–46].
COVID-19 and PD: shared in ﬂammatory pathways under
oxidative stress
SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity to generate a dysregulation of
cytokines- “cytokine storm “[47]. In order to regulate the infection
that might damage neurons, cytokines such interleukin receptor-2,
interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor are released by infected
neurons [ 48]. The development of both COVID-19 and PD may be
signiﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by oxidative stress and cytokine storm.Moreover, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may break down as a result
of the severe systemic in ﬂammatory response brought on by viral
infection. As a result, peripheral cytokines may be able to enter the
CNS, where they may cause or exacerbate neuroin ﬂammation [ 49].
Virus-induced in ﬂammation is thought to contribute to neurode-
generation [ 50], as is “multiple hit ”damage [ 51]. Just like the “two
hit”concept of PD, the COVID-19 infection might have served as an
infectious second hit [ 52]. The in ﬂammatory response induced by
acute or chronic infection may initiate or accelerate early andsubclinical processes underlying the early stages of PD. Addition-
ally, research on neurodegenerative diseases and other viral
infections indicates that systemic in ﬂammation brought on by
SARS-CoV-2 infection may further contribute to neuroin ﬂammatory
processes and increase susceptibility to PD [ 53]. Also, the discovery
of possible therapeutic strategies for the treatment of COVID-19
and PD is aided by the targeted suppression of caspases andnuclear factor kappa B activation [ 54]. Due to the anti-in ﬂammatory
properties of vitamin D3, regular supplementation with 2000 –5000
IU/day of D3 may help older persons with PD reduce the evolution
of their condition and may also provide further protection againstCOVID-19 [ 55].
α-synuclein
The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system suffers from neurodegen-eration brought on by α-synuclein, which is clinically evident as
the usual PD/parkinsonian symptoms. α-synuclein overexpression
is thought to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2neuroinfection causes increased levels of α-synuclein [ 46,47].
Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to cause α-synuclein aggre-
gation in the brains of COVID-19 cases [ 56]. In vitro experiments
have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein speeds up theaggregation of α-synuclein [ 57]. N-protein microinjection dis-
rupted the α-synuclein proteostasis and enhanced cell mortality in
SH-SY5Y cells [ 57]. Besides. the SARS-CoV-2 infection may
potentially hinder the removal of α-synuclein. The overexpression
ofα-synuclein, which may play a role in the immune response [ 58],
may then cause microglia to become active [ 59]. Microglia cells
would amp up the in ﬂammatory response and release in ﬂamma-
tory cytokines and chemokines, which would result in neuronaldeath [ 60,61]. Furthermore, glutamate excitotoxicity, which is
connected to neuronal degeneration, may result from neuroim-
mune reactions to an infection [ 62,63]. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2
infection seems to affect α-synuclein and death of dopaminergic
neurons, which is known to cause PD.
Glial cells
Astrocytes and microglia, in particular, are now considered to play
a signi ﬁcant role in both bene ﬁcial and negative host responses
during CNS illness states [ 64]. With the increasing number of
individuals infected and re-infected across the world, microgliamay have a role in the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19
neurological diseases, including PD [ 65]. By up-regulation of
inﬂammatory cytokine genes and enhanced BBB permeability,
reactive astrocytes are frequently engaged in processes of
neurodegeneration and neuroin ﬂammation. When pathogen-
derived or endogenous ligands are detected by injured cells,pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are produced byastrocytes and microglia, start the innate immune response [ 66].
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a well-known class of PRRs, might be
involved in the cytokine storm brought on by SARS-CoV-2 [ 67]. In
fact, TLR4, are likely to detect SARS-CoV-2-derived molecularpatterns and trigger an in ﬂammatory response. TLR2 and
TLR7/TLR8 are also activated by SARS-CoV-2 [ 68], A cytokine
storm in the CNS may emerge from the simultaneous activation of
several TLRs. TLRs contribute to PD by mediating the associated
neuroin ﬂammation and glial activation [ 69]. The interaction
between α-synuclein and microglial TLR2 promotes the growth
and spread of α-synuclein pathology [ 69].F. Jia and J. Han

Cell Death Discovery          (2024) 10:146 Endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondria
As SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously inhibited the expression of
SELENOF, SELENOM, SELENOK, and SELENOS, the endoplasmic
reticulum is an organelle that is badly damaged by the virus.Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein responseare driven by coronavirus replication in infected cells [ 70–73].
Although endoplasmic reticulum-resident selenoproteins are
known to have a role in preserving endoplasmic reticulumhomeostasis, a connection between coronavirus infection andendoplasmic reticulum-resident selenoproteins has not yet been
established [ 74]. Moreover, mitochondria have a role in the
induction of the in ﬂammatory response, including the production
of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species(ROS) and the up-regulation of the expression of genes linked to glycolysis-related
enzymes, which has also been extensively reported in the CNS in
COVID-19 [ 75]. Dysregulation of the mitochondrial ACE2/MrgE/NO
axis may have a signi ﬁcant effect on the neurodegenerative
processes of dopaminergic neurons, where mitochondrial dys-
function and oxidative stress may have a substantial impact [ 76].
FERROPTOSIS SIGNATURE IN SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND
MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF FERROPTOSISA case study of a COVID-19 patient has showed the presence of aferroptosis signature in cardiac and renal tissues [ 77]. The ﬁnding
was the ﬁrst to document a ferroptosis signature in COVID-19,
which was thought to be a risk factor for organ damage. Moreover,an in vitro investigation revealed that glutathione peroxidase 4
(GPX4), which was the brake of ferroptosis, was reduced by SARS-
CoV-2 [ 78]. SARS-CoV-2 infects pacemaker cells easily, resulting in a
noticeably increased rate of ferroptosis [ 79]. A growing body of
research has revealed that ferroptosis plays signi ﬁcant pathogenetic
roles in cancer, ischemia organ damage, and dementia since it was
ﬁrst used by Dixon et al. [ 80]. The precise mechanism underlying
ferroptosis is still unknown, but it is known that altered ironmetabolism, glutathione (GSH) depletion, GPX4 inactivation, and
increased PUFA peroxidation by ROS play key roles in its onset and
progression [ 80,81]. In general, iron overload in cells, decreased
GPX4 and xCT expression, activation of acylCoA synthetase long-chain family member-4 (ACSL4) and lysophosphatidylcholine
acyltransferase-3, and an increase in lipid peroxidation are the four
main mechanisms that induce ferroptosis [ 82–84].
THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF FERROPTOSIS UNDERLIES COVID-19-
RELATED PDFerroptosis may exist in COVID-19-related PD
A potentially lethal aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the
involvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms, as was mentionedabove. Ferroptosis has been identi ﬁed as a key mechanism for the
death of dopaminergic neurons in PD [ 85]. Severe behavioral
impairment and neuronal death of mice given the ferroptosis
inhibitor ferrostatin-1 24 h before 1-methyl- 4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP) were greatly reversed [ 86]. Ferrostatin-1
also has a neuroprotective impact on SH-SY5Y cells injured by
rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium(MPP
+)[87,88], sug-
gesting that ferroptosis could offer an alternative for treating PD.The enhanced ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-166 analogs, two
members of the new generation of ferroptosis inhibitors, can be
used to assess the involvement of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2infection as well as to potentially treat COVID-19 [ 89,90].
Dysregulation of iron metabolism in COVID-19-related PD
Iron metabolism impairment, a signi ﬁcant contributor to PD
[91,92], has been extensively established in a signi ﬁcant fraction
of COVID-19 patients in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 93–95],
which corresponds with the risk of severe and fatal COVID-19illness. In our previous study, we elaborated the mechanism ofdysregulation of iron metabolism and ferritinophagy in COVID-19
[96,97]. In addition, ceruloplasmin levels in long-term COVID-19
patients exhibit a declining tendency when compared to those in
COVID-19 patients and healthy controls [ 98]. PD is partly caused
by the neurotoxicity of iron accumulation brought on byinadequate or reduced ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin
[99,100]. The accumulation of iron may cause a rise in the
intracellular labile iron (II) pool and Fenton reaction, which resultsin the production of lipid ROS, and ferroptosis. Intracellular irondepletion would be potential treatment options for COVID-19.
Deferoxamine and imatinib have been shown to prevent SARS-
CoV-2 infection of pacemaker cells as well as SARS-CoV-2infection-induced ferroptosis [ 79].
GSH-GPX4 axis in COVID-19-related PD
Mitochondrial ROS production was increased by SARS-CoV-2infection and its replication [ 101]. GPX4, located in the mitochondria,
speci ﬁcally guards against the ferroptotic cell death. GPX4 gene
expression is suppressed by SARS-CoV-2, which promoted the occurof ferroptosis. A fundamental investigation that infected Africangreen monkey kidney (Vero) cells with patient-derived SARS-CoV2
discovered that the mRNA levels of GPX4 were considerably
downregulated, suggesting a connection between ferroptosis andSARS-CoV-2 [ 78]. Leukopenia in COVID-19 patients may be related to
ferroptosis in leukocytes and suppressed GPX4 caused by SARS-CoV-
2[102].The lack of GPX4 induced the loss ability of GSH be
peroxidized to minimize the lipid ROS produced by the Fentonreaction. Lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis would therefore follow
from an accumulation of lipid ROS. Consequently, it ’s probable that
ferroptosis contributes to the PD symptoms of COVID-19 (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
Challenges in establishing causal relationships betweenCOVID-19 and PDMany concerns still need to be addressed, despite the fact that
numerous linked research about COVID-19 and PD are beginning
to emerge. It is uncertain if distinct SARS-CoV-2 strains causedifferent neurological symptoms. To determine the connectionbetween SARS-CoV-2 mutations and PD manifestations, further in-
depth analyses are required. Moreover, it has been discovered that
several forms of cell death, such as autophagy, apoptosis, andpyroptosis, are implicated in the pathogenic mechanism of both
COVID-19 and PD [ 103,104]. Since it is currently rather challenging
to determine the cross-talk among different cell death pathways inCOVID-19 related PD, none of the above mentioned mechanismsof cell death, other than ferroptosis, are explored in this review.
Furthermore, the age and gender of the SARS-CoV-2 infection
victim, which might be contributing variables to the developmentof PD, are not assessed. Moreover, it would be required to accountfor both environmental and genetic in ﬂuences.
Both direct neuronal invasion and indirect effects of neuroin-
ﬂammation may be involved in the neuropsychiatric symptoms of
COVID-19. A deeper comprehension and functional characterize of
COVID-19 related PD will be possible through the use of high
throughput assessment and patient-derived organoids, which mayprovide a viable means of elucidating pathophysiologic hints andpossible treatment approaches.
The Potential clinical implications of ferroptosis in COVID-19
related PDAs a novel form of cell death, ferroptosis has great promise for study in
COVID-19 associated with PD. A po tential treatment approach might
involve focusing on ferroptosis. So f ar, iron chelators and lipophilic
antioxidants have been the principal approaches of suppressing
ferroptosis [ 105]. Through the control of the Fenton reaction, iron
chelators such as deferoxamine che late iron and halt lipid peroxida-
tion. It is important to note that iron alterations in the brainF. Jia and J. Han

Cell Death Discovery          (2024) 10:146 may be easily tested using quantit ative susceptibility mapping [ 106].
Ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 a re typical lipophilic antioxidants
that scavenge lipid peroxides and inhibit ferroptosis. Studies havedemonstrated that both iron chelato rs and lipophilic antioxidants
could prevent the progression of PD [ 107]. Furthermore, deferoxamine
lowers the amounts of IL-6, a major in ﬂammatory cytokine generated
during COVID-19 [ 108], suggesting that deferoxamine may be used as
a medication to treat COVID-19-induced PD. Nevertheless, no study
has yet evaluated the effectiveness of lipophilic antioxidants in theCOVID-19 therapy process. Moreover , future research should look into
the potential bene ﬁts of combining anti-in ﬂammatory cytokines with
ferroptosis interference to improve the resilience of COVID-19-related
PD patients, considering that in ﬂammatory cytokine storms are
believed to be key contributors to COVID-19.
To the best of our knowledge, neither clinical trials assessing
ferroptosis inhibitors in COVID-19 related PD nor any indication of
the ferroptosis signature in the brain tissues of COVID-19 patientsexist. Though we have made great progress in understanding the
pathogenic role of ferroptosis in PD, the precise role that
ferroptosis plays in the brain damaged by SARS-CoV-2 and howit initiates the in ﬂammation that ultimately causes brain damage is
unclear. In addition, it is hard to describe ferroptosis is a side effect
of SARS-CoV-2 infection or if it ’s a way for the virus to replicate and
become more dangerous during COVID-19. Despite we haveelucidated the connection between three primary ferroptosispathways and COVID-19, which path is more important in COVID-
19-related brain damage? It is necessary to address these issues in
order to make a complete and convincing argument for thetherapeutic use of ferroptosis inhibitors.
CONCLUSION REMARK
From the beginning of the epidemic, scientists have been working
feverishly to discover a new COVID-19 vaccine or possible
treatment. This review generally overviews the relationshipbetween COVID-19 and PD (Fig. 2). The course of the COVID-19and PD exhibit similarities in some biochemical processes, including
oxidative stress, in ﬂammation, and protein aggregation [ 53]. Since
that COVID-19 exhibits unusual symptoms including GSH depletion,GPX4 inactivation, abnormal iron metabolism, and elevation of
PUFA peroxidation by reactive oxygen species, it is possible that
SARS-CoV-2 might cause ferroptosis in the dopaminergic neurons,which would then contribute to PD. Therefore, this review presents
evidence that ferroptosis is intimately linked to and holds
considerable promise for research on COVID-19-related PD, whichprovide a promising research direction. We speculate thatferroptosis contributes to SARS-CoV-2 infection-related PD in light
of the possible link between ferroptosis and neurological
abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Although there is a lack ofevidence on effective treatment strategies for COVID-19-related PD,one potentially effective tactic would be to target ferroptosis.
However, it is yet unknown how ferroptosis functions in SARS-CoV-
2 infected dopaminergic neurons or whether it represents apromising new therapeutic target for COVID-19-related PD therapy.
Further researches are aggressively explored to con ﬁrm that
ferroptosis occurs in COVID-19, clarify its precise mechanism, anddetermine if it is linked to brain damage associated with COVID-19.

Fig. 2 Mechanisms of pathogen invasion and its potential contribution to the PD. SARS-CoV-2 might in ﬁltrate the CNS directly through the
olfactory, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, blood-brain barrier. The infection could prompt cytotoxic aggregation of α-synuclein,
endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondria damage, neuroin ﬂammation, and ferroptosis, which induce dopaminergic neurons degeneration.F. Jia and J. Han

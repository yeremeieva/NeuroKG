The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still in ﬂuential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is
associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of
research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception
until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identi ﬁed:
serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body ﬂuids; serotonin 5-HT 1Areceptor binding; serotonin transporter
(SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-
environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and speci ﬁc subtypes of depression (e.g.
bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies
using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed
using a modi ﬁed version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included
overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviewsand meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative
synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high
quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association withdepression (largest n=1002). One meta-analysis of cohort studies of plasma serotonin showed no relationship with depression,
and evidence that lowered serotonin concentration was associated with antidepressant use ( n=1869). Two meta-analyses of
overlapping studies examining the 5-HT
1Areceptor (largest n=561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining
SERT binding (largest n=1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be
consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly.
However, effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies foundno effect in most healthy volunteers ( n=566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression ( n=75).
Another systematic review ( n=342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies ( n=407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic
review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERTgene, one genetic association study ( n=115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis ( n=43,165), revealed no evidence of an
association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research
provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis
that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility thatlong-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.

INTRODUCTION
The idea that depression is the result of abnormalities in brain
chemicals, particularly serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), hasbeen in ﬂuential for decades, and provides an important justi ﬁcation
for the use of antidepressants. A link between lowered serotonin
and depression was ﬁrst suggested in the 1960s [ 1], and widely
publicised from the 1990s with the advent of the Selective SerotoninReuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants [ 2–4]. Although it has beenquestioned more recently [ 5,6], the serotonin theory of depression
remains in ﬂuential, with principal English language textbooks still
giving it quali ﬁed support [ 7,8], leading researchers endorsing it
[9–11], and much empirical research based on it [ 11–14]. Surveys
suggest that 80% or more of the general public now believe it is
established that depression is caused by a ‘chemical imbalance ’
[15,16]. Many general practitioners also subscribe to this view [ 17]
and popular websites commonly cite the theory [ 18].

demonstrate that depression must be at least partially caused
by a brain-based chemical abnormality, and that the apparent
efﬁcacy of SSRIs shows that serotonin is implicated. Other
explanations for the effects of antidepressants have been putforward, however, including the idea that they work via an
ampli ﬁed placebo effect or through their ability to restrict or blunt
emotions in general [ 19,20].
Despite the fact that the serotonin theory of depression has
been so in ﬂuential, no comprehensive review has yet synthesised
the relevant evidence. We conducted an ‘umbrella ’review of the
principal areas of relevant research, following the model of asimilar review examining prospective biomarkers of majordepressive disorder [ 21]. We sought to establish whether the
current evidence supports a role for serotonin in the aetiology of
depression, and speci ﬁcally whether depression is associated with
indications of lowered serotonin concentrations or activity.
METHODS
Search strategy and selection criteria
The present umbrella review was reported in accordance with
the 2009 PRISMA statement [ 22]. The protocol was registered
with PROSPERO in December 2020 (registration numberCRD42020207203) ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_
record.php?RecordID =207203 ). This was subsequently updated
to re ﬂect our decision to modify the quality rating system for
some studies to more appropriately appraise their quality, and to
include a modi ﬁed GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the
ﬁndings in each category of the umbrella review.
In order to cover the different areas and to manage the large
volume of research that has been conducted on the serotonin
system, we conducted an ‘umbrella ’review. Umbrella reviews survey
existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses relevant to a researchquestion and represent one of the highest levels of evidencesynthesis available [ 23]. Although they are traditionally restricted to
systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we aimed to identify the best
evidence available. Therefore, we also included some large studiesthat combined data from individual studies but did not employconventional systematic review methods, and one large genetic
study. The latter used nationwide databases to capture more
individuals than entire meta-analyses, so is likely to provide evenmore reliable evidence than syntheses of individual studies.
We ﬁrst conducted a scoping review to identify areas of
research consistently held to provide support for the serotoninhypothesis of depression. Six areas were identi ﬁed, addressing the
following questions: (1) Serotonin and the serotonin metabolite 5-
HIAA –whether there are lower levels of serotonin and 5-HIAA in
body ﬂuids in depression; (2) Receptors - whether serotonin
receptor levels are altered in people with depression; (3) Theserotonin transporter (SERT) - whether there are higher levels of
the serotonin transporter in people with depression (which would
lower synaptic levels of serotonin); (4) Depletion studies - whethertryptophan depletion (which lowers available serotonin) can
induce depression; (5) SERT gene –whether there are higher
levels of the serotonin transporter gene in people with depression;(6) Whether there is an interaction between the SERT gene andstress in depression.
We searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large
database studies in these six areas in PubMed, EMBASE andPsycINFO using the Healthcare Databases Advanced Search toolprovided by Health Education England and NICE (National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Searches were con-
ducted until December 2020.
We used the following terms in all searches: (depress* OR
affective OR mood) AND (systematic OR meta-analysis), and
limited searches to title and abstract, since not doing so producednumerous irrelevant hits. In addition, we used terms speci ﬁct oeach area of research (full details are provided in Table S1,
Supplement). We also searched citations and consulted with
experts.
Inclusion criteria were designed to identify the best available
evidence in each research area and consisted of:
1. Research synthesis including systematic reviews, meta-analysis,
umbrella reviews, individual patient meta-analysis and large datasetanalysis.
2. Studies that involve people with depressive disorders or, for
experimental studies (tryptophan depletion), those in which mood
symptoms are measured as an outcome.
3. Studies of experimental procedures (tryptophan depletion) invol-
ving a sham or control condition.
4. Studies published in full in peer reviewed literature.5. Where more than ﬁve systematic reviews or large analyses exist, the
most recent ﬁve are included.
Exclusion criteria consisted of:
1. Animal studies.
2. Studies exclusively concerned with depression in physical conditions
(e.g. post stroke or Parkinson ’s disease) or exclusively focusing on
speci ﬁc subtypes of depression such as postpartum depression,
depression in children, or depression in bipolar disorder.
No language or date restrictions were applied. In areas in which
no systematic review or meta-analysis had been done within the
last 10 years, we also selected the ten most recent studies at the
time of searching (December 2020) for illustration of more recentﬁndings. We performed this search using the same search string
for this domain, without restricting it to systematic reviews and
meta-analyses.
Data analysis
Each member of the team was allocated one to three domains ofserotonin research to search and screen for eligible studies using
abstract and full text review. In case of uncertainty, the entire team
discussed eligibility to reach consensus.
For included studies, data were extracted by two reviewers
working independently, and disagreement was resolved by
consensus. Authors of papers were contacted for clari ﬁcation
when data was missing or unclear.
We extracted summary effects, con ﬁdence intervals and mea-
sures of statistical signi ﬁcance where these were reported, and,
where relevant, we extracted data on heterogeneity. For summaryeffects in the non-genetic studies, preference was given to theextraction and reporting of effect sizes. Mean differences were
converted to effect sizes where appropriate data were available.
We did not perform a meta-analysis of the individual meta-
analyses in each area because they included overlapping studies[24]. All extracted data is presented in Table 1. Sensitivity analyses
were reported where they had substantial bearing on interpreta-
tion of ﬁndings.
The quality rating of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was
assessed using AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess
systematic Reviews) [ 25]. For two studies that did not employ
conventional systematic review methods [ 26,27] we used a
modi ﬁed version of the AMSTAR-2 (see Table S3). For the genetic
association study based on a large database analysis we used the
STREGA assessment (STrengthening the REporting of GeneticAssociation Studies) (Table S4) [ 28]. Each study was rated
independently by at least two authors. We report ratings of
individual items on the relevant measure, and the percentage of
items that were adequately addressed by each study (Table 1, with
further detail in Tables S3 and S4).
Alongside quality ratings, two team members (JM, MAH)
rated the certainty of the results of each study using a modi ﬁed
version of the GRADE guidelines [ 29]. Following the approach ofJ. Moncrieff et al.

Heterogeneity- not reported
(N=40,749)29%
Extracted summary effects, con ﬁdence intervals and measures of statistical signi ﬁcance are reported. In reviews in which multiple meta-analyses were conducted, only summary effect sizes that were statistically
signi ﬁcant are reported, with relevant negative ﬁndings that did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance listed. Where no relevant analysis was statistically signi ﬁcant, the results of the principal analysis (e.g., main gene
effect) is reported. Data on heterogeneity is reported where relevant. Where sample size for a particular analysis was different from the total sampl e size, this is reported. For summary effects in the non-genetic
studies, preference was given to the extraction and reporting of effect sizes. Mean differences were converted to effect sizes where appropriate dat a were available [25]. Where these data were not available the
most relevant measure, such as the beta co-ef ﬁcient, or average percentage change in ligand binding was reported. For genetic association studies, and gene-stress interactions studies we odds r atios are
reported.CSFCerebrospinal ﬂuid,gHedges g, GWAS Genome Wide Association Studies, MDD Major Depressive Disorder, N/Anot applicable, OROdds Ratio, SMD Standard Mean Difference.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, neuropsychiatric,autonomic, and other nonmotor symptoms. The efﬁcacy ofdeep brain stimulation (DBS) for the motor symptoms of ad-vanced PD is well established. However, the effects of DBS on
the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms are less clear.
The neuropsychiatric aspects of DBS for PD have recently beenof considerable clinical and pathophysiological interest. As acompanion to the preoperative and postoperative sections of theDBS consensus articles, this article reviews the published lit-erature on the cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects of DBS
for PD. The majority of the observed neuropsychiatric symp-
toms are transient, treatable, and potentially preventable. Out-
come studies, methodological issues, pathophysiology, andpreoperative and postoperative management of the cognitive
and neuropsychiatric aspects and complications of DBS for PD
are discussed. © 2006 Movement Disorder Society

A range of neuropsychiatric symptoms have been in-
creasingly recognized in Parkinson’s disease (PD) andare presumed to be due to the underlying neurodegen-erative process, dopaminergic medications, underlyingvulnerabilities, and/or psychosocial factors. These symp-toms range from disorders of cognition, mood (depres-sion, mania), anxiety, hallucinations, to apathy.
1,2More
recently, a group of behaviors resulting from the chronic
and pulsatile administration of dopamine (the dopaminedysregulation syndrome) has been identiﬁed.
3These be-
haviors include “hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation”or a form of excessive and pathological use of dopami-nergic medications for nonmotor purposes and medica-tion-induced hypersexuality and pathological gambling.
While the efﬁcacy of bilateral deep brain stimulation(DBS) for the motor symptoms of advanced PD has beenwell established,
4the effects of DBS on these nonmotor
cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are less clear.
Thisarticle expands on the cognitive and neurobehav-
ioral aspects of DBS for PD and is intended as a com-panion to the preoperative and postoperative sections ofthe consensus articles. The concept of neuropsychologi-cal or cognitive issues and neuropsychiatric or neurobe-havioral issues will be separated for the sake of clarity,although overlaps will occur. It is recognized that on aclinical level, the assessment, management, and patho-physiology of these symptoms do not exist indepen-dently. It should be noted that in the vast majority ofwell-selected patients, DBS has demonstrated efﬁcacyand safety. Furthermore, despite the range of postopera-tive psychiatric symptoms reported, the majority of

preventable.
As very few data on stimulation of the ventrointerme-
dial nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus exist, this article willfocus primarily on the published literature on stimulationof the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidusinternus (GPi) for PD. Outcome studies, methodologicalissues, pathophysiology, and the preoperative and post-operative management of the cognitive and psychiatricaspects of DBS for PD are discussed. The outcomes arecovered in more detail in the preoperative and postoper-ative sections of the consensus articles and will only bebrieﬂy discussed here. The focus of the article is onmethodological and pathophysiological issues. Issues re-garding preoperative and postoperative management ofpsychiatric aspects of DBS are found primarily in thetables.
OUTCOME STUDIES
A range of postoperative cognitive and neurobehav-
ioral symptoms have been reported following STN DBSand GPi DBS. While cognitive and neurobehavioralsymptoms were found to be less frequent following GPicompared to STN DBS in several small studies,
5–7the
literature is far from conclusive as detailed comparativedata have not been published. The discrepancies in neu-robehavioral outcome have been postulated to be relatedto changes in dopaminergic medications, anatomical dif-ferences between the STN and GPi, and methodologicalissues. For instance, STN DBS is associated with agreater reduction in dopaminergic medications than GPiDBS and symptoms such as depression and apathy havebeen have been linked to postoperative dopaminergicwithdrawal states.
8,9Consequently, some of the post-
STN stimulation neurobehavioral symptoms might re-ﬂect differences in management of dopaminergic medi-cation following surgery rather than surgical site per se.Alternatively, the STN is much smaller and more vari-able in orientation than the GPi. Thus, current spread toadjacent nonmotor circuits and possible electrode mis-placement are more likely to occur with STN than GPiDBS, thereby resulting in greater stimulation-relatedneurobehavioral symptoms. Finally, it is likely thatmethodological issues and biases in the literature con-tribute to the perception that STN DBS is associated withgreater neurobehavioral morbidity. For example, the lit-erature on GPi DBS has small cohort sizes, limitedlong-term follow-up data, and does not focus on neuro-psychiatric issues. The apparently greater rate of cogni-tive and psychiatric adverse events after STN comparedto GPi DBS may also reﬂect report bias. The earlystudies examining outcome following GPi DBS focused
on motor symptoms with relatively little attention paid tononmotor symptoms. In contrast, the more recent STNDBS studies have made a more concerted attempt toevaluate nonmotor as well as motor outcome followingsurgery. Similarly, while there have been no reports ofpsychiatric symptoms and very few cognitive studiesfollowing Vim DBS, this literature has the same meth-odological limitations and further selection bias issues asthe GPi literature.
As there is a more comprehensive literature including
several reviews on neuropsychological outcomes follow-ing DBS surgery for PD, we refer readers to recentcomprehensive reviews pertaining to the neuropsycho-logical literature.
10,11 The outcome studies on cognition
and stimulation for advanced PD are summarized inTable 1.
Subthalamic Stimulation
Cognitive Outcomes
The vast majority of the neuropsychological outcome
literature following DBS for PD has been published withpatients who underwent DBS in the STN. The ﬁndingsfrom these studies must be viewed with signiﬁcant cau-tion as most studies suffer from small sample sizes andonly three of the published studies included a PD controlgroup.
12–14
The majority of the outcome literature suggests that
STN DBS results in relatively little cognitive morbidityin well-selected patients.
13,15–20 Isolated studies note
mild improvements in mental ﬂexibility,15,21,22 working
memory,22visuomotor sequencing,16,20,22,23 conceptual
reasoning,22,23 and overall cognitive function.23
The most robust ﬁnding across studies appears to be a
decline in word ﬂuency,12–16,20,23–27 although other stud-
ies have also reported declines in verbal memo-ry,
13,15,23,24,28,29 conditional associative learning,22visuo-
spatial memory,15,24,29 processing speed,24and selected
measures of executive function.29Speciﬁc patient sub-
groups (e.g., older patients, patients with moderate cog-nitive impairment prior to surgery) may be at greater riskof sustaining cognitive and neurobehavioral deﬁ-cits.
15,24,28 –30 However, this has not been unequivocally
demonstrated. For example, the available data do notmake it clear if older age per se or other medical comor-bidities associated with older age are responsible for theincreased neurobehavioral changes found in some olderpatients following surgery.
Most studies include dementia as an exclusionary cri-
terion; thus, there are no large-scale prospective dataS306 V. VOON ET AL.

Movement Disorders, Vol. 21, Suppl. 14, 2006surgery in the three patients and the bulk of the literature
indicates that stimulation does not result in marked cog-nitive declines.
Although most of the literature suggests that STN
DBS is relatively benign from a cognitive perspective,there are reports of patients who sustained signiﬁcantcognitive decline following surgery. Morrison and col-leagues
13stated that 1 of their 20 subjects demonstrated
signiﬁcant cognitive decline following surgery with laterimprovement in function following STN stimulation. De-spite the improvement noted with stimulation, his overallcognitive function was worse after surgery and he had tomove from an independent to an assisted living settingdue to cognitive changes. He was an older man, butanother case report by Hariz and colleagues
31docu-
mented a similar negative outcome in a 53-year-oldfollowing placement of DBS electrodes in the STN.Thus, it does not appear that age per se is the onlypredictor of a potentially deleterious cognitive outcome.To date, little has been done to assess potential cognitiverisk factors systematically.
Only a handful of studies have systematically exam-
ined the role of stimulation and/or medications on neu-ropsychological performance. Systematic assessmentON and OFF STN stimulation demonstrated either nosigniﬁcant cognitive effects
13or improvements in pro-
cessing speed,20,22 working memory,20,22 random number
generation,21,22 and problem-solving22with stimulation.
One study demonstrated a decline in performance on aconditional associative learning task
22following stimu-
lation, and impairments in response inhibition measures(self-detected errors on Stroop interference task) havealso been documented.
21Performances on working
memory and response inhibition measures under high-cognitive-demand conditions were shown to decline withSTN stimulation.
32Systematic assessment onand off
medications during STN stimulation was not associatedwith cognitive changes
19on a variety of neuropsycho-
logical measure, including tests sensitive to frontostriataldysfunction [the Raven Color Matrices, Corsi BlockTapping Test, Bisyllabic Words Repetition Test, PairedAssociates Learning Test, Spatial Learning Test, River-mead Behavioural Memory Test, Visual Search Test,Reaction Times Tests, Modiﬁed Wisconsin Card SortingTest, Trial Making B Test, and word ﬂuency measures(category, phonemic)]. These ﬁndings are at odds withprevious reports in the literature that demonstrated cog-nitive changes associated with dopaminergic medica-tions in unoperated PD patients. The discrepant ﬁndingsmight reﬂect methodological issues such as limitedpower or measurement factors and clearly, more data areneeded to evaluate the role of medication status in cog-
nitive function ON and OFF STN DBS.
Neuropsychiatric Outcomes
Like cognitive outcomes, the outcome data on neuro-
psychiatric symptoms should be approached with cautiondue to similar methodological issues. The following fre-quencies of postoperative psychiatric symptoms havebeen reported following STN stimulation. Transient con-fusion in the immediate postoperative period has beenreported in 1% to 36% of patients.
4,8,18,33– 40 Postopera-
tive hypomania has been reported in 4% to 15% of
patients, usually occurring within the ﬁrst 3 postopera-
tive months.18,38,41,42 Emotional reactivity, or excessive
mood-congruent emotional responses to minor triggers,was identiﬁed in 75% of STN stimulation patients.
30
Suicide attempts and/or suicides have been documentedin uncontrolled series ranging from 0.5% to2.9%.
18,30,43,44 A multicenter study of 450 STN DBS
patients reported a postoperative suicide rate of 0.5%.45
In contrast, a study of 120 patients who underwent DBS
(including PD, dystonia, and essential tremor patients)documented a postoperative suicide rate of 2.9% in PDpatients who had undergone STN DBS.
44
Individual episodes of postoperative depression have
been reported in 1.5% to 25% of patients.8,18,30,33,38,46 – 48
Although overall group depression scores have beenreported to improve at 3, 12, and 36 months,
8,26,42,49,50
the clinical relevance of these ﬁndings is not clear. Stud-ies designed to examine mood symptoms utilizing stan-dardized diagnostic criteria reported frequencies of 21%and 25% with the onset of depression within the ﬁrst 2postoperative months.
25,30 Another study distinguishing
between depression requiring antidepressants and de-pression secondary to dopaminergic withdrawal symp-toms reported rates of 18% and 38%, respectively.
8In a
large 3-year study using patient-rated depression scalecutoff scores, moderate to severe depression was docu-mented at baseline in 33%, in 20% in the ﬁrst postoper-ative year and in 15% in the third postoperative year.
26
Without a control group, the implications of these re-
ported frequencies are not clear. Potential misinterpreta-
tions of ﬁndings in uncontrolled studies are illustrated inthe literature on pallidotomy. Early uncontrolled studiessuggested an elevated risk of postoperative depressionfollowing bilateral posteroventral pallidotomy.

ever, a subsequent prospective randomized wait list con-
trol group study did not demonstrate any differences indepression outcomes in the surgical or wait list controlgroup.

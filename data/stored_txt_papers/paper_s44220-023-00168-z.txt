Brain texture as a marker of transdiagnostic 
clinical profiles in patients with recent-onset 
psychosis and depression
The inter-relationships of voxels can be captured by the radiomics texture 
features across multiple spatial scales. Prediction models of brain texture changes captured by the contrast texture feature in recent-onset psychosis (ROP) and recent-onset depression (ROD) have recently been proposed, although the validation of these m od els t ra ns  di ag no  st ically at the individual 
level and the investigation of the variability in clinical profiles are lacking. Established prevention and treatment approaches focus on specific diagnoses and do not address the heterogeneity and manifold potential outcomes of patients. Here we aimed to investigate the cross-sectional utility of brain texture changes for (1) identification of the psychopat hological state (ROP and ROD) and (2) the association of individualized brain texture maps with clinical symptom severity and outcome profiles. We developed transdiagnostic models based on structural magnetic resonance imaging data for 116 patients with ROD, 122 patients with ROP and 197 healthy control participants from the PRONIA (Personalized pROgNostic tools for early psychosIs mAnagement) study by applying a set of tools and frameworks to explain the classification decisions of the deep-learning algorithm (named explainable artificial intelligence) and clustering analysis. We investigated the contrast texture feature as the key feature for the identification of a g  en er al p sy chopathological state. The discrimination 
power of the trained prediction model was >72% and was validated in a 
second independent age- and sex-matched sample of 137 ROP, 94 ROD and 159 healthy control participants. Clustering analysis was implemented to map the changes in texture brain produced from an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm, in a group fashion. The explained individualized brain contrast map grouped into eight homogeneous clusters. In the clinical group, we investigated the association between the explained brain contrast texture map and clinical symptom severity as well as outcome profiles. Different patterns in the explained brain contrast texture map showed unique associations of brain alterations with clinical symptom severity and clinical outcomes, that is, age, positive, negative and depressive symptoms, and functionality.

that are associated with distinct neuroimaging profiles across both 
diagnoses25,37. In the present analysis, the contrast texture feature map 
expresses the gray-level differences of non-segmented magnetic reso -
nance images, capturing inter-relationships of the segments and the 
cortical folding. Combining the captured information with an explain -
able artificial intelligence algorithm, which explains the classification 
decision, gives insights regarding the association of the pattern that the 
algorithm uses for classification with the clinical profile and outcome, 
grouped in homogeneous clusters of the symptom. The current study 
seeks (1) to investigate whether or not a transdiagnostic set of structural 
alterations can characterize ROP and ROD, and if any such alterations 
may reflect markers of psychiatric illness, and (2) to investigate associa -
tions between transdiagnostically individualized brain markers and 
clinical symptom severity as well as outcome profiles. We used a large 
training sample of ROP and ROD data and an independent validation 
sample, both of which are from the Personalized pROgNostic tools for 
early psychosIs mAnagement (PRONIA) study27. The measures of inter -
est were radiomics texture features, based on previous findings by our 
group, where the contrast texture feature map has been identified as 
the key feature for psychosis14,37. Mathematically, the contrast feature 
expresses the shape abnormalities in the brain cortex and the surface 
relief of the cortical boundary. Finally, we performed explainable artifi -
cial intelligence analysis, a set of tools which supports the explanation 
of the classification decision, to highlight the brain regions that most 
contributed to differences between the ROD and ROP patients. We 
hypothesized that (1) ROP and ROD present shared contrast texture 
feature abnormalities and (2) different contrast feature patterns are 
associated with different transdiagnostic clinical profiles. The goal of our study was to investigate the usefulness of neuroimaging markers for the transdiagnostic prediction of outcome profiles. In this sense, our results serve mainly as a proof of concept that should be followed 
up in larger samples. We believe that there is merit in our results as they 
showcase the feasibility and potential relevance of transdiagnostic 
approaches.
Results
Sample characteristics
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the three participant 
groups (ROP, ROD and healthy control (HC)) for the training sample 
are presented in Table 1. In the training sample, there were no statisti-
cally significant differences between ROP, ROD and HC with respect to 
age, sex and ethnicity. There were statistically significant differences 
between ROP and ROD with respect to specific psychopathological 
symptoms and psychosocial functioning (see Table 1 ). The power analy -
sis on the training sample showed that 94 ROP + ROD and 78 HC is the 
minimum sample size that results in a comparative fit index greater 
than 0.9.
In the validation baseline sample (age- and sex-matched with the 
training sample—see ‘Training and validation samples’ in the Methods), 
there were no statistically significant differences between ROP, ROD 
and HC with respect to age, sex and ethnicity. There were statistically 
significant differences between ROP and ROD with respect to spe -
cific psychopathological symptoms and psychosocial functioning  
(see Table 1).In mental health, diagnosis and treatment depend nearly entirely on a 
syndromal classification that defines diagnostic categories based on 
symptom clusters1–3. However, comorbidity has long been recognized 
as the rule rather than the exception, with half of the patients that fulfill 
the diagnostic criteria for one disease also meeting the criteria for at 
least one other condition4,5.
Common etiologies and symptoms are observed in psychotic 
disorders and depression, which may indicate overarching, transdi -
agnostic pathogenetic mechanisms6,7. Hence, a broader approach that 
acknowledges the complexity of mental illnesses is essential to unravel 
the determinants of specific psychopathologies8–10. Such transdiagnos -
tic approaches may be helpful in advancing therapeutic discovery by 
enabling symptoms to be investigated on multiple levels of analysis, 
for example, manifest psychiatric syndromes versus latent psychopa -
thology dimensions. Potential advantages include the ability to classify 
and treat multiple psychological disorders using the same treatment protocol, as well as the capacity to better address comorbidities.
The interconnection of psychotic disorders and depressive 
syndromes showcases the above issue. Depressive symptoms can 
be observed in the prodromal stage before the first manifestation of 
psychotic symptoms, during the first or later psychotic episodes, after 
the fading out of an acute episode and as a sign of relapse8. Depression 
may result from the neurobiological processes of psychotic disorders9, 
as a side effect of antipsychotic drugs, as an outward manifestation 
of problematic symptoms or as a psychological response to psycho -
sis as a significant life experience10. For an explanation of the con -
nection between depression and psychosis, numerous models have 
been presented11,12. Despite the growing emphasis on transdiagnostic 
approaches to mental health, it is unclear if distinct diagnostic cat-
egories share a common neuronal base and our knowledge is based on 
meta-analyses of studies that were carried out on individual disorders 
using different methodologies13.
Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) studies have identi -
fied common brain abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and 
depression (for example, in cerebral white matter14 or the cerebel -
lum15,16). Volume deficits and structural brain abnormalities have been 
linked to both schizophrenia17,18 and depression19,20. These changes have 
also been observed in patients with recent-onset psychosis (ROP)17,21– 24 
and recent-onset depression (ROD)25–28, and have a wide distribution, 
affecting the frontal, temporal and parietal cortical regions as well as the subcortical, cerebellar, insula and callosal regions
29–31. Moreover, 
abnormalities in the white matter (WM) of the brain and cerebrospi -
nal fluid (CSF) have been reported in both psychotic and depressive 
disorders32–35. However, it is unclear how the observed brain changes 
translate to clinical symptoms and how different brain-change profiles 
correspond to different symptom profiles, that is, whether or not posi -
tive and negative symptoms, depressive symptoms and functionality are associated with different brain topologies.
Despite having information from structural brain imaging studies 
on psychosis that date back more than 40 years, so far it has not been 
possible to find a diagnostic or predictive biomarker for use in clinical 
settings. Small sample sizes, ambiguous biomarker definitions and 
a dearth of replications36 have been suggested to be responsible for 
these shortcomings. On the basis of brain volumetric changes, cross-sectional studies have reported different symptom clusters (positive texture map values and/or brain contrast texture voxels that contributed 
significantly to the classification decision predicted accurately the PANSS (positive and negative symptom scale) scores, functionality and change  in functionality over time. In conclusion, we created homogeneous  
clusters which predict the clinical severity and outcome profile in ROP  and ROD patients.Nature Mental Health | Volume 2 | January 2024 | 76–87 78

A repeated nested pooled cross-validation classifier of brain contrast 
texture maps achieved a balanced accuracy of 72.43%, a sensitivity of 
74.40% and a specificity of 74.45% for discrimination of patients (pooled 
ROD and ROP) from the HC participants (Table 2 ). A total of 231 age- and 
sex-matched participants was included in the independent validation 
sample, with 139 participants classified correctly as ROD + ROP (bal -
anced accuracy 60.27%, sensitivity 61.20% and specificity 58.65%). In 
the independent validation follow-up sample, 137 participants were 
included, where 77 participants were classified correctly and 60 of 
them provided all the clinical variables.
Implementation of the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) 
algorithm for multilayer neural networks, as described in Bach et al.38, 
showed that voxels with the highest contribution to the difference 
between patients and HC participants (that is, those with the highest relevance for the classification decision) were located in the cerebel-
lum, anterior and posterior midline areas, frontotemporal areas and 
right insula (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). In addition, we 
investigated cortical biomarkers for the general psychopathology in 
gray matter (GM), WM and CSF . The regions of interest were extracted 
using the AAL-VOIs atlas (https://doi.org/10.1006/nimg.2001.0978). 
We used the Johns Hopkins University ( JHU) WM tractography atlas39 
to identify the WM tractography identified by the LRP.
Brain relevance association with clinical outcome profile
The association of the brain relevance with clinical symptoms and 
outcome profiles was investigated in the validation sample. Clinical variables at the baseline were available for 131 patients from the vali -
dation sample (out of 139 classified correctly) and 71 patients of the 
follow-up sample. We support identifying patterns in the brain rel -
evance heatmaps that were associated with the severity of clinical symptoms and outcome profiles. We applied the affinity propaga
-
tion (AP) algorithm40 to cluster the brain relevance heatmaps of the 
validation sample blindly14,37, resulting in eight clusters. Inside each 
cluster, we calculated (1) the SANS factor scores (for the avolition, aso -
ciality, anhedonia, alogia and blunted affect subgroups), GAF and BDI 
total scores as well as the PANSS factor scores (for the positive, nega-tive, distress, excitement and disorganization subgroups) at baseline  
(Fig. 2) and (2) the change scores of these variables at the one-year 
follow-up time (Fig. 3). The resulting clusters are presented in Figs. 2 
and 3. We summarize the findings here on the basis of the symptom 
sum scores, as described above, and the outcome profile (details in 
Supplementary Table 7). Cluster 1 (number of subjects (N ), N = 9 at 
baseline and N  = 6 at follow-up) presented high BDI and PANSS_negative 
values, an improvement in PANSS_negative over time and a deteriora-
tion in PANSS_disorganization and the SANS scores related to alogia and 
blunted affect over time (Supplementary Fig. 3). In contrast to Cluster 
1, Cluster 3 (N  = 21 at baseline and N  = 12 at follow-up) presented low BDI 
values and improvement in PANSS_disorganization as well as a high 
deterioration of the SANS_asociality and SANS_anhedonia scores and the BDI after 1 year. We speculate that the brain relevance in Cluster 3 
has prognostic power for depression. Cluster 2 (N = 8 at baseline and 
N = 5 at follow-up) presented a high value for the GAF and low values for 
the PANSS_negative and SANS factor scores, with a marked improve -
ment in the BDI and SANS_blunted affect and a deterioration in GAF , 
SANS_anhedonia and SANS_avolition over time. In contrast to Cluster 2, 
Cluster 4 (N  = 12 at baseline and N  = 6 at follow-up) presented low values 
in total GAF and high values in the SANS factor scores, with marked 
improvement in GAF , SANS_asociality and SANS_alogia over time and 
marked deterioration of the PANSS scores over time. We speculate 
that the negative symptoms in the baseline were a secondary effect of 
the primary positive symptoms. Cluster 6 (N  = 31 at baseline and N  = 17 
at follow-up) and Cluster 7 (N  = 6 at baseline and N  = 5 at follow-up) 
captured older and younger ages, respectively. Cluster 7 presents a 
high improvement in the SANS_avolition and SANS_anhedonia scores. 
Finally, Cluster 5 (N  = 22 at baseline and N  = 9 at follow-up) presented low 
a SANS_blunted affect score and deterioration in the PANSS scores over 
time, and Cluster 8 (N  = 22 at baseline and N  = 11 at follow-up) showed a 
strong improvement in the PANSS_positive scores over time.
In clusters with a sufficient number of participants (Clusters 3, 5, 
6 and 8), we repeated regression analyses to predict clinical outcomes 
at baseline and changes in the scores between baseline and follow-up, 
using the mean relevance of the brain heatmap as a predictor (in Table 
1, the mean and standard deviation scores of the ROP and ROD partici -
pants in the follow-up are presented). In Cluster 3, the mean relevance 
map predicted an improvement of the PANSS score factors (positive, 
disorganization, distress and excitement) and the SANS_anhedonia 
score with negative coefficients (Supplementary Table 8.1). In Cluster 8, 
the mean relevance map predicted an improvement of the PANSS_posi -
tive score factor with a positive coefficient (Supplementary Table 8.2). 
In addition, we tested the prediction values of the relevance of the 
voxels that contributed most to the classification decision. There were 
differential associations between voxel relevance and symptoms in 
the different clusters, especially for Clusters 3, 5, 6 and 8. In Cluster 3, the voxels in specific brain areas that are associated with low depres-
sive symptoms (that is, fusiform, temporal lobe and insula from the 
left hemisphere; see Supplementary Table 7) predicted PANSS scores (for the excitement, disorganization and positive subgroups) and an 
improvement of functionality. In Cluster 5, the brain relevance predicts 
the improvement of functionality from the left temporal lobe and in 
the right-hemisphere calcarine, lingual gyrus and precuneus regions. 
In Cluster 6, the brain relevance associated with high age predicts the Table 2 | Classification results

improvement of functionality from the left temporal lobe.
Furthermore, we calculated the volumes of the regions with pre-
dicted value to check if the contribution of the voxels to the classifica -
tion decision was driven by the volumetric changes. In all clusters with 
high numbers of participants (that is, Clusters 3, 5, 6 and 8), the brain 
volume in the detected regions was uncorrelated with the classifica -
tion relevance of the respective regions, with the exception of the 
precentral and frontal lobe regions that are not contributing to the 
statistical models (Fig. 4 ).
Discussion
In this study, across patients with ROD or ROP we identified eight 
clusters of brain heatmap patterns that showed differential associa -
tions with symptom clusters, functionality and age; that is, clinical 
heterogeneity in transdiagnostic psychopathology was reflected in 
homogeneous clusters of contrast texture brain changes. The brain 
regions contributing most to the classifier decision overlap with those 
implicated in psychotic and depressive disorders in studies that have 
assessed changes in the GM and WM of patients37. This fact and the 
proof-of-concept results of this study support our notion that neu -
roimaging biomarkers are useful for the prediction of transdiagnos -
tic outcome profiles. We used the contrast feature map and the LRP 
method suggested by Bach et al.38 to train and explain a classifier for 
identification of the transdiagnostic psychopathology. The model 
showed good accuracy in classifying a combined group of ROD and 
ROP patients against HC participants in the training sample, which 
decreased in the external validation sample. However, the innovative finding of this study is the creation of homogeneous clusters that are 
associated with clinical severity and outcome profiles. The current 
analysis provides an example of how the proposed method can be 
applied to link the transdiagnostic symptoms (rather than categorical 
diagnoses) to brain structure. Our ultimate vision pertains to multi -
dimensional prediction, investigating neuroanatomical markers of 
longitudinal changes in symptoms and functionality across diagnoses.
Changes in the hippocampus, insula and lateral prefrontal cortex 
have been observed in patients with ROD (for example, a decrease in 
volume in medial temporal regions)27 and ROP (for example, a volume 
deficit in the anterior hippocampus)41, which emphasizes the implica -
tion of brain alterations in the early stages of both illnesses. Using our method, GM analysis in transdiagnostic psychopathology showed 
brain changes in regions that have been reported in other studies, for example, the cerebellum
20, the frontal lobe42, temporal regions43, the 
cingulum bundle44 and the precuneus45, rectus46, insula47, Heschl’s 
gyrus48, lingual49 and putamen left50 regions. The explained classifi -
cation results using the contrast feature maps indicate the posterior 
cingulate cortex, gyrus rectus, third ventricle (consistent with our 
previous results in patients with schizophrenia and major depressive 
disorder14) and insular (consistent with previous study for clinical high 
risk who transitioned to psychosis and first-episode psychosis37,51) as 
key regions for the transdiagnostic classification of psychopathology 
(see Table 3 for further details).
In people with mental-health problems, there is mounting evi -
dence of decreased WM function that results in problems of synchro -
nization and connectivity52, with fractional anisotropy (FA) evaluated 
via diffusion tensor imaging being the most extensively used meas -
ure. Throughout the phases and progression of psychosis, neural 
alterations, particularly changes in WM connectivity, could be seen53. 
Consistent findings of significantly lower FA in the left genu of the 
corpus callosum, the left anterior corona radiata and the right superior 
longitudinal fasciculus have been reported in ROP patients relative to 
HC participants33,54,55. Functional dysconnectivity in the dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex have been revealed in major depression56. Expansion of 
the third ventricle has been reported in the recent onset of psychosis57. 
Other studies have reported abnormalities in WM integrity as measured by FA in major depressive disorders
34. The above findings are in line with 
our results regarding the WM changes in the frontal gyrus, gyrus rectus, 
dorsal anterior and corpus callosum. The third and fourth ventricles have been reported as regions that contribute to the identification of 
the transdiagnostic psychopathology using the contrast texture map.
The brain relevance calculated using the LRP algorithm resulted in 
clusters that showed differential associations with age, positive, nega -
tive and depressive symptom clusters as well as functionality. Previous 
studies that performed sMRI-based prediction models determined 
social functioning in the patients with ROD27. In some clusters, mean 
relevance values and/or the relevance of voxels contributing signifi -
cantly to the classification decision accurately predicted the PANSS and 
SANS sum scores, functionality and change in functionality over time. 
Significant contributing voxels were located in regions that have previ -
ously been associated with these scores. In previous studies on schizo -
phrenia and ROD, the FA of the temporal part and the temporolimbic –3–2–1012Age_T0

This study examines the growth of scientific literature on Parkinson's disease from 1983 to 2017, focusing on the contributions by various countries and the journals publishing this research. The analysis used data retrieved from the Science Citation Index-Expanded database, specifically looking at articles that mentioned Parkinson's disease in their titles, abstracts, or keywords, while excluding those related to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. 

The research papers were grouped into seven five-year intervals starting from 1983-1987 through to 2013-2017. The study tracked the number of research articles from each country, attributing articles from multinational research equally among the contributing countries. Additionally, it identified the top ten most prolific journals in the field within these intervals. 

Over the 35-year period, the study found a substantial increase in the volume of Parkinson's disease research, with the number of articles growing 33-fold from 885 in the initial period to 29,972 in the last. The number of countries participating in this research expanded from 37 to 131. The United States consistently led in terms of productivity, followed by several European countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France) and English-speaking nations (Canada, Australia). From 2003, Asian countries including China, South Korea, India, and Turkey, showed significant growth in their output. By the last period, China ranked second globally, trailing only the United States. Despite an increase in African countries participating in Parkinson's disease research, most contributed very few papers.

The number of journals publishing articles on Parkinson's disease also saw a significant increase, from 232 to 2,824. Three journals focused on Parkinson's disease (Parkinsonism & Related Disorders, Movement Disorders, and Journal of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease) accounted for 6.8% of all articles in the last five-year period, while a vast majority of journals published ten or fewer papers on the topic.

This quantitative analysis complements existing qualitative reviews, offering a global perspective on Parkinson's disease research.

Deep brain stimulation is a significant clinical technique for treating movement disorders that no longer respond well to drugs. However, its advancement has been slowed by a lack of progress in technological methods and device development. Recent collaborative efforts between bioengineers, neuroscientists, and clinical practitioners have led to a better understanding of how deep brain stimulation works. This has paved the way for new solutions to overcome previous challenges. This article outlines the need for advances in deep brain stimulation from a neurophysiological standpoint and discusses technological advancements currently being evaluated for clinical use soon.

Deep brain stimulation is a recognized option for treating severe movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, tremor, and dystonia, significantly reducing motor deficits for many patients. Despite its benefits, deep brain stimulation is complex and requires a high level of expertise, involving a multidisciplinary approach where failures can occur due to various reasons, including incorrect patient selection, electrode misplacement, poor programming, or inadequate postoperative management of stimulation and drug treatment. Movement disorders are characterized by highly variable symptoms and severity, which fluctuate with different states, necessitating a personalized and dynamic treatment strategy. Therefore, recent research has focused on how a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of movement disorders and the physiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation could lead to therapy that can better adjust to individual patient needs, reduce the need for extensive clinical programming, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.

Despite the clinical success in treating movement disorders and its expansion to other conditions like psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, or pain, the technical advancement of neurostimulation devices has been limited. Only recently, with new competitors entering the market, has there been a push for technical innovation in devices, providing physicians with more flexible programming options and clinical research tools to validate neurophysiological concepts in practice.

The article briefly reviews current concepts of deep brain stimulation mechanisms, identifies needs for translational advances in methodology, and describes the available technical solutions that may soon transform clinical practice. It covers various aspects, including the need for directional deep brain stimulation, novel pulse parameters, computational models, identification of disease-specific biomarkers, and novel stimulation patterns that could selectively suppress disease-specific brain activity. These advancements aim to improve the selectivity and efficiency of deep brain stimulation, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients with fewer side effects.

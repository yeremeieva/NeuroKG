In a study focused on overweight young females, the impact of concurrent training combined with health education and nutrition management on body composition and health-related outcomes was investigated. Twenty-four healthy overweight females, with an average age of about 20 years and a body mass index indicating overweight status, were divided into two groups. One group underwent concurrent training alone, while the other group received additional health education and managed their calorie intake based on their basal metabolic rate. Both groups participated in an 8-week concurrent training program, consisting of aerobic and resistance exercises six days a week.

The findings revealed that both groups experienced significant weight loss, with the group receiving additional health education and nutrition management achieving greater reductions in body mass, total fat mass, and body fat percentage. Despite these differences in weight loss and fat reduction, improvements in serum glucose, lipids, insulin, and progesterone levels were observed in both groups without significant differences between them.

This study highlighted that concurrent training is effective for reducing fat mass and improving fasting glucose, blood lipids, and related hormones in the short term. Additionally, incorporating health education and nutrition management can enhance the effects on weight loss and fat reduction, offering a more effective approach to obesity treatment.

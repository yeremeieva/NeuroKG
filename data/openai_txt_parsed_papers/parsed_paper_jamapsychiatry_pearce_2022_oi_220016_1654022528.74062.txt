Depression is a major cause of mental health-related disease burden worldwide, affecting a significant portion of the global population. Physical activity has been suggested as a means to reduce the risk of developing depression, yet the specific amount of physical activity needed to achieve this benefit has been unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the dose-response relationship between physical activity and the risk of developing depression in adults by analyzing data from published prospective studies.

Various databases were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria, which involved prospective cohort studies of adults that reported on physical activity at three or more exposure levels and provided risk estimates for depression with a sample size of 3000 or more adults and a follow-up period of three years or longer. The data extraction process involved two independent reviewers and utilized a two-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis to synthesize the data.

The main outcome of interest was the incidence of depression, which included the presence of major depressive disorder as indicated by self-report, registry data, or diagnostic interviews, as well as elevated depressive symptoms identified using validated cutoffs for a depressive screening instrument.

The analysis included fifteen studies comprising 191,130 participants and 2,110,588 person-years. The results revealed an inverse curvilinear dose-response association between physical activity and depression, with more significant benefits observed at lower levels of activity. Specifically, compared to adults who did not report any physical activity, those engaging in half the recommended volume of physical activity (4.4 marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week) had an 18% lower risk of depression. Those meeting the recommended volume of 8.8 marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week had a 25% lower risk, with diminishing additional benefits observed at higher activity volumes.

The findings suggest that even levels of physical activity below current public health recommendations can offer significant mental health benefits. Health practitioners are encouraged to promote any increase in physical activity to help improve mental health outcomes. This comprehensive review highlights the potential for physical activity to serve as a preventive measure against depression, emphasizing the importance of physical activity for mental health.

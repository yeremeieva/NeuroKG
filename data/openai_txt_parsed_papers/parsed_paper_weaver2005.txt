Ablative brain surgery was utilized in 1912 to treat Parkinson's disease. The introduction of levodopa in the 1960s led to a significant decline in surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease. However, the limitations of levodopa therapy soon became evident, as Parkinson's disease continued to progress and treatment-related complications such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias emerged as major challenges. This led to a resurgence in neurosurgical interventions, particularly ablative procedures like pallidotomy. Despite its widespread use, the limitations of pallidotomy, including adverse effects like speech impairment, balance and gait problems, visual field defects, and cognitive deficits, were recognized. This prompted the search for safer and more effective surgical treatments, especially for bilateral symptoms, and increased interest in deep brain stimulation.

Deep brain stimulation, which uses electrical stimuli to create a functional lesion within a specific brain area, has two primary targets for treating Parkinson's disease: the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus. The first reports of deep brain stimulation for managing Parkinson's disease appeared in the mid-1990s. Subsequent studies have documented significant improvements in patient motor functioning and quality of life following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. However, serious adverse events, including infections, depression, mood changes, psychosis requiring intervention, and equipment issues such as lead fractures and dislodgements, have been reported. Globus pallidus internus stimulation studies have also shown improved motor function and increased time spent in the "on" state, along with an enhanced perceived quality of life. However, serious complications have been reported for bilateral globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation, including hematomas, infections, and equipment issues. Despite low mortality rates, the rate of serious complications underscores the need for systematic tracking, recording, and comparing adverse outcomes according to the stimulation target.

Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease has gained widespread acceptance over the years, confirmed by an analysis of practice patterns that now considers deep brain stimulation the preferred surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease. However, significant questions remain, including which stimulation target site leads to better outcomes and whether certain patients or specific symptoms respond better to one target over another. A small study randomly assigned patients to receive either globus pallidus internus or subthalamic nucleus stimulation and evaluated outcomes in a blinded manner, finding improvements in motor function regardless of the stimulation target. However, a larger trial is needed to confirm these findings.

In the absence of a large randomized trial, a systematic review was conducted to quantify what has been learned about the outcomes of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. This meta-analysis synthesized the results of published research on patient outcomes following bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus targets in the brain.

A rising number of patient cases suggest a probable link between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and Parkinson's disease, yet the mechanisms by which the virus affects the brain and generates neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients remain unknown. Ferroptosis, a distinct iron-dependent non-apoptotic type of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion, a key factor in neurological disorders. Ferroptosis may have a pathogenic role in the disease, according to recent findings, however, its potential contributions to the disease-related Parkinson's disease have not yet been investigated. This review covers potential paths for the virus infection of the brain. Among these putative processes, ferroptosis may contribute to the etiology of the disease-associated Parkinson's disease, potentially providing therapeutic methods.

Facts include that ferroptosis may play a pathogenic role in the disease, and the brain is infected by the virus via potential paths. Ferroptosis may contribute to the etiology of the disease-associated Parkinson's disease. Open questions include the links between the disease and Parkinson's disease and the potential role of ferroptosis in disease-related Parkinson's disease.

The introduction notes the global impact of the virus epidemic, often known as the disease pandemic. As of a certain date, there have been numerous confirmed cases worldwide, including millions of deaths. The impact of the disease has been unsurpassed thus far, and its long-term effects might be far more disastrous. The virus, which causes the current pandemic, affects more than just the respiratory system, it also affects other organs and tissues. The virus has recently been discovered in neurons in several parts of the brain, including the substantia nigra. Several individuals with infections have reported experiencing acute and subacute neurological complications. Due to a number of causes that cause a reduction in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra followed by striatal dopamine depletion, patients with Parkinson's disease have a variety of motor and non-motor impairments. This review explores current evidence indicating a potential pathogenic link between the disease and Parkinson's disease and provides directions for potential therapeutic approaches that target ferroptosis.

The review discusses the neurological manifestations of the disease in Parkinson's disease, exploring the links between the virus neurotropism and Parkinson's disease, including the potential impact of ferroptosis in disease-related Parkinson's disease. Methods for the review included searching databases for relevant articles, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, and conducting a search selection.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) presents a complex and multifaceted management scenario for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) post-surgery. The management strategy encompasses early postoperative management, follow-up care, and the handling of long-term complications and issues. This article aims to cover the key aspects of DBS postoperative management and decision-making, incorporating a systematic review of literature and expert opinions. This report has received endorsements from significant neurological and surgical societies.

General management after DBS surgery starts with standard postoperative care, assuming the surgery goes uncomplicated. Patients typically resume their antiparkinsonian medications as soon as possible to mitigate discomfort and reduce the risk of acute withdrawal symptoms. Postoperative imaging, like MRI or CT scans, is recommended to confirm electrode placement and check for surgical complications.

Programming of the DBS device usually begins after the effects of microlesioning, caused by the surgical procedure, have worn off. This process involves assessing the stimulation effects on symptoms like rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia, and optimizing stimulation parameters for the best outcomes. The programming session is crucial for selecting the optimal electrode contact and setting the stimulation parameters that provide the greatest symptom relief with minimal side effects.

Follow-up care involves training patients or caregivers on how to manage the stimulator device, scheduling regular visits for ongoing assessment and adjustment of stimulation parameters, and deciding on the necessity of OFF stimulation assessments for evaluating the patient's condition without DBS effects.

Common postoperative issues include weight gain, management of dyskinesias, and other symptoms that may arise from the stimulation or the progression of Parkinson's disease itself. Strategies for managing these issues often involve adjusting stimulation settings and medication doses to find a balance that maximizes symptom control while minimizing side effects.

Long-term complications, such as device infection, loss of efficacy, and hardware-related problems, require ongoing vigilance and management strategies to ensure patient safety and comfort. Additionally, DBS patients may face social, job-related, and lifestyle adaptations post-surgery.

In conclusion, the management of Parkinson's disease patients following deep brain stimulation surgery is an evolving field that requires a tailored approach for each individual. By addressing the wide range of postoperative issues and optimizing DBS settings, healthcare providers can significantly improve the quality of life for these patients. Further research is needed to refine these management strategies and address any gaps in knowledge.

Analysis of the relationship between neural oscillation phases and amplitudes has become increasingly recognized as a key process in brain network dynamics. In Parkinson's disease, initial studies have found abnormal coupling of beta-phase to gamma-amplitude in various brain regions, including the subthalamic nucleus. This study investigated the local field potentials from the bilateral subthalamic nucleus in eight Parkinson's disease subjects who had undergone deep brain stimulation surgery. These individuals were examined during both standing and walking without disturbances. The phase-amplitude coupling was analyzed using the Kullback-Liebler method, focusing on the modulation index. This analysis was then correlated with clinical evaluations, kinematic analyses, and individual molecular brain imaging studies using single-photon emission computed tomography. The findings revealed a dopamine-related increase in beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling from standing to walking. Moreover, patients exhibiting poor modulation of this coupling, particularly during walking, showed an increase in the duration of the stance and double support phases in the gait cycle. These results provide new insights into the role of the subthalamic nucleus in gait control and suggest that cross-frequency coupling could serve as a mechanism for conveying specific motor control information for locomotion in humans.

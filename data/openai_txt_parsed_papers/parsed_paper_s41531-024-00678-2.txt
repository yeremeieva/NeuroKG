The research focused on the most disabling motor sign of Parkinson's disease, postural instability, which often leads to an increased chance of falling and loss of independence. Existing clinical assessments of Parkinson's disease-related postural instability rely on subjective tests that only evaluate reactive balance, highlighting the need for objective, multi-dimensional assessments that reflect daily living activities. 

In this study, machine learning models were trained on insole plantar pressure data from participants, including those with Parkinson's disease and control groups, as they performed simulated static and active postural tasks typical of daily activities. These models were highly accurate in distinguishing Parkinson's disease patients from young and age-matched controls, as well as identifying Parkinson's disease patients who had experienced falls from those who had not. Features from both static and active postural tasks significantly improved classification performance, with tasks posing higher postural threats being more effective for differentiating Parkinson's disease fallers from non-fallers.

Postural instability in Parkinson's disease leads to falls, loss of independence, and in severe cases, physical injuries and immobilization. Despite its significance, the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease-related postural instability is poorly understood, and current treatments offer little or no response. The lack of quantitative, objective, and accessible approaches to effectively characterize postural instability in individuals with Parkinson's disease contributes to the challenge.

Monitoring insole plantar pressure could offer a simple, low-cost, and accessible method to assess postural control through center of pressure measurements in each foot. This study leveraged previous findings indicating differences in center of pressure features between individuals with Parkinson's disease and those at risk of falling, the development of insole pressure sensors for convenient data collection outside clinical settings, and the selection of balance tasks that engage different aspects of the postural control system. The aim was to train machine-learning models for the detection of Parkinson's disease and patients at risk of falls. The study's findings underscore the potential of using insole plantar pressure monitoring in conjunction with machine learning models to improve the assessment of postural instability and fall risk in Parkinson's disease, contributing to better management and treatment strategies.

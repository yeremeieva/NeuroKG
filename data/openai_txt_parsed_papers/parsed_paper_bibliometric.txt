The article in question delves into the bibliometric analysis of research related to deep brain stimulation. This research aimed to identify and examine the characteristics of the 100 most cited papers in the field of deep brain stimulation. The Web of Science was utilized to search for these papers, taking into account the number of citations, countries and institutions of origin, year of publication, and research area. The analysis revealed that the average citations per article were 304.15, with a yearly average of 25.39 citations. The subthalamic nucleus was the most frequently targeted area in these studies. The articles were published across 46 high-impact journals, with "Brain" journal publishing the highest number of these articles. The studies originated from 11 countries, with the highest number of articles coming from the United States. However, the University of Toronto in Canada was the institution with the most highly-cited studies. This study not only identified the top 100 most cited studies in deep brain stimulation but also provided a historical perspective on the progress in this field, highlighting influential reports and suggesting areas for future research.

Materials and methods involved querying Thomson Reuters' Web of Science for articles related to deep brain stimulation, using a combination of keywords to rank results by citation numbers. The criteria for inclusion were peer-reviewed articles on deep brain stimulation research, including original research and review articles, while the exclusion criteria involved patents, books, non-biomedical publications, conference abstracts, case reports, and articles not focusing on deep brain stimulation as a treatment. The top 100 articles were identified based on citation numbers, and additional analyses were performed to assess trends and patterns in deep brain stimulation research.

The results showed a peak in highly-cited studies after the year 2002, with most studies published between 2000 and 2009. The analysis revealed a diversity in the countries contributing to deep brain stimulation research, with the United States being the leading country. Institutions like the University of Toronto were among the top contributors. The research was published across a variety of high-impact journals, with the field of deep brain stimulation encompassing a wide range of study areas and targets, including Parkinson's disease, the subthalamic nucleus, and other neurological and psychiatric conditions. The study provided insights into the most influential research in the field of deep brain stimulation, underscoring the importance of this treatment modality in neurosurgery and neurology.

Depression has emerged as a significant threat to global health, prompting researchers worldwide to delve into its study. To foster further research, understanding the global knowledge landscape of depression research is crucial. This study sets out to create a knowledge map of depression research, showcasing the current research distribution, hotspots, frontiers, and trends in this field, thereby providing researchers with valuable insights and ideas. Utilizing bibliometric and data visualization methods, the study systematically analyzed aspects such as country, journal, category, author, institution, cited article, and keyword based on depression research data from the Web of Science core collection spanning 2004 to 2019. A network showcasing the relationships in depression research was established, highlighting the most influential countries, journals, categories, authors, institutions, cited articles, and keywords in this field.

The analysis reveals significant potential for further research in depression, offering scientific guidance for researchers to identify potential collaborations through collaboration and coexistence networks. It presents the hotspots, frontiers, and gaps in depression research through a global research knowledge map, using information analysis and fusion methods. This provides valuable information for researchers and institutions to identify meaningful research directions.

Health issues are increasingly important due to healthcare advancements and the mounting social pressures in a rapidly developing society. Prolonged exposure to stress negatively impacts brain development, with depression being a typical disorder resulting from such stress. Depression, also known as major depression, clinical depression, or melancholia, is a debilitating mental illness characterized by mood disorders. It accounts for a significant portion of the affected population worldwide, with more than 350 million people suffering from depression, marking an 18% increase over the last decade and a lifetime prevalence of 15%. It has become a major cause of global disability and disease burden, posing a threat to millions worldwide.

The quantification of science, flourishing alongside the rise of science communication research, benefits from the explosive growth of research output in the big data era. Bibliometrics, blending "data science" and modern science, leverages topics, authors, publications, keywords, references, citations, etc., to more accurately and scientifically reveal the current status and impact of disciplines. However, the wealth of bibliometric studies related to depression remains limited. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive and systematic literature-based data mining and metrics analysis of depression-related research, focusing on cooperative network and co-presentation analysis based on papers included in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2004 to 2019. It offers an in-depth analysis of cooperative networks, co-presentation networks, and co-citation through modern metrics and data visualization methods. By mining key data and exploring data correlations, the study aims to predict depression-related information scientifically and reasonably, showcasing the spatial and temporal distribution of research countries, journals, authors, and institutions in depression research through a relational network. This deep understanding of the research community's internal structure will help researchers and institutions establish more accurate and effective global collaborations, aligning with human destiny and globalization trends. Additionally, the study aims to identify gaps in current research, establish a more targeted research direction, obtain a complete picture of today's new developments in the field of depression, and inform further adjustments to the research protocol. These analyses will help researchers understand the evolution of this study field, using literature data analysis to identify research hotspots, analyze the knowledge structure within different studies, and provide a basis for predicting research frontiers.

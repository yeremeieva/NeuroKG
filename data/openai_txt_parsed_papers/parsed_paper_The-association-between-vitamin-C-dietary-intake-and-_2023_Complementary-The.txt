The relationship between vitamin C dietary intake and its serum levels with anthropometric indices has been explored through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This research aimed to examine the connection between the consumption and blood levels of vitamin C and various body measurements.

A thorough search was conducted across several databases including Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, concluding in August 2021. The study included all observational research that investigated the association between dietary or circulating levels of vitamin C and body mass index and waist circumference in adults. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the National Institute of Health quality assessment tool.

Out of 11,689 studies identified, 47 were included in the systematic review, and 37 in the meta-analysis. The findings revealed a significant inverse correlation between waist circumference and serum vitamin C levels, as well as between body mass index and serum vitamin C levels. Higher consumption of vitamin C was significantly linked with lower body mass index. Additionally, no significant differences in serum vitamin C levels were found between normal-weight and overweight individuals, but serum vitamin C levels were significantly higher in obese individuals compared to those of normal weight.

The research concluded that both dietary and serum levels of vitamin C are inversely associated with body mass index and waist circumference. However, to further understand the potential role of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention and treatment of obesity, more well-designed clinical trials are required. 

Weight disorders have risen significantly over the past decades and are linked with various health complications such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Several factors including genetics, environment, socioeconomic status, and nutritional status have been identified as contributors to weight disorders. Overweight and obesity are associated with increased inflammatory markers and reactive oxygen species, which contribute to various complications. Antioxidants like vitamin C are thought to have protective effects against these complications due to their ability to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation.

Vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin, plays several roles including wound healing, iron absorption, collagen synthesis, and acting as a cofactor for various enzymes. Despite its known benefits, studies examining the relationship between vitamin C status and body measurements have shown inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify these associations by reviewing observational studies on the topic.

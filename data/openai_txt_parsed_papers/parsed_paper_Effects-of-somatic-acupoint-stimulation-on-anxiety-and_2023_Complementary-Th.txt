This systematic review evaluates the impact of somatic acupoint stimulation (SAS) on anxiety and depression in individuals with cancer. Thirteen electronic databases were searched up to August 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of SAS on anxiety and/or depression in cancer patients. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Back Review Group Risk of Bias Assessment Criteria, and the level of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Both meta-analysis and descriptive analysis were conducted to assess outcomes.

A total of twenty-eight records were included, comprising 22 journal articles and six ongoing registered clinical trials. The methodological quality and evidence level of the included studies were found to be suboptimal, with no high-quality evidence identified. Moderate evidence indicated that SAS could significantly reduce anxiety in cancer patients, with significant reductions observed in both acupuncture and acupressure groups. Regarding depression, data analysis suggested that SAS could significantly decrease depression, although the evidence was rated as low. No statistically significant differences were found between true and sham acupoint stimulation for either anxiety or depression.

The systematic review supports SAS as a potentially effective intervention for reducing anxiety and depression in cancer patients. However, due to methodological concerns in some included studies and the relatively small sample size in some sub-group analyses, the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. Further well-designed large-scale RCTs with placebo-controlled comparisons are needed to provide high-quality evidence.

The review protocol was registered, and a comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases. Studies were included if they were RCTs comparing SAS (manual acupuncture or manual acupressure) to sham SAS, waiting-list, or standard methods of treatment and care. The primary outcomes were anxiety and/or depression as measured by validated patient-reported measures. Secondary outcomes included patients' quality of life and adverse events associated with SAS.

The included studies varied in terms of cancer types, sample sizes, and intervention protocols. Most studies utilized validated instruments for measuring anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Two main modalities of SAS, manual acupuncture and manual acupressure, were used in the interventions. The studies assessed outcomes at different time points, ranging from immediately post-intervention to several weeks after the completion of the intervention.

In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that SAS has the potential to alleviate anxiety and depression in cancer patients. However, due to the limitations of the existing evidence, further research is necessary to confirm these findings and to establish SAS as a standard complementary therapy for managing anxiety and depression in this population.

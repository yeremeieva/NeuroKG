**Summary of Scientific Paper: New Methods for the Assessment of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (2005 to 2015): A Systematic Review**

**Introduction:**
* There has been a surge in the development of new technologies (NAM-PD) for assessing Parkinson's disease (PD).
* This review aimed to evaluate the maturity, feasibility, and usefulness of these methods.

**Methods:**
* Systematic search of studies published from 2005 to 2015 in PubMed and Web of Science databases.
* 588 original research articles were evaluated.
* Parameters assessed: technology used, demographic characteristics, clinimetric properties (accuracy, agreement, responsiveness, repeatability), and technology readiness level (TRL).

**Results:**

**Technology Used:**
* Inertial measurement units (IMUs), accelerometers, and gyroscopes were commonly used.
* Wearable NAM-PD were increasingly prevalent.

**Clinimetric Properties:**
* Less than 50% of studies used standard validation methods.
* Only 8% confirmed their results in different datasets.
* The axial features domain was most frequently studied, followed by bradykinesia.
* Accuracy and agreement measures were often reported, but responsiveness and repeatability were underrepresented.

**TRL:**
* 45% of studies used NAM-PD with TRL 1-3, indicating a need for further development.
* Only 8% of NAM-PD reached TRL 9, indicating proven applicability in a clinical environment.

**Discussion:**

**Key Findings:**
* NAM-PD have the potential to improve PD assessment, but many are still in early stages of development.
* Standardized validation methods and collaborative studies are needed to confirm preliminary results and assess understudied domains.

**Future Directions:**
* Focus on validating existing and developing new NAM-PD for less-studied domains, such as non-motor symptoms and treatment complications.
* Improve clinimetric properties of NAM-PD to ensure reliable and meaningful measurements.
* Foster collaboration and data sharing to accelerate the translation of NAM-PD into clinical practice.

**Conclusion:**
* This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of NAM-PD and highlights areas for future research and development.
* Standardization, validation, and collaboration are crucial for advancing the field and improving the assessment and management of PD.

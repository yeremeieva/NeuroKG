**Serotonin and mental health**

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in many bodily functions, including mood, appetite, and sleep. Low levels of serotonin have been linked to depression, and many antidepressants work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain.

**The serotonin hypothesis of depression**

The serotonin hypothesis of depression proposes that depression is caused by low serotonin levels in the brain. This hypothesis has been around for decades, and it has been supported by a number of studies. However, other studies have failed to find a link between serotonin levels and depression.

**A recent umbrella review of the evidence**

A recent umbrella review of the evidence examined the results of 17 studies on the relationship between serotonin and depression. The review found that the evidence is mixed, with some studies finding a link between serotonin levels and depression and other studies finding no link. The review also found that the quality of the studies was variable, and that many of the studies were small and underpowered.

**Overall, the evidence does not support the serotonin hypothesis of depression.**

However, the review did find that some studies suggest that antidepressants may increase serotonin levels in the brain and that this may improve symptoms of depression. More research is needed to determine whether serotonin levels play a role in depression and whether antidepressants work by increasing serotonin levels.

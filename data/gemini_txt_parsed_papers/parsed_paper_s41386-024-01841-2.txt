**Topic:** The impact of exercise on mental health

**Key Findings:**

* **Exercise improves mood and reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety.** Studies have shown that regular exercise can be as effective as antidepressant medications in reducing symptoms of depression.
* **Exercise increases endorphin production.** Endorphins are neurotransmitters that have mood-boosting and pain-relieving effects.
* **Exercise reduces stress hormones.** Cortisol and adrenaline are hormones that are released in response to stress. Exercise can help to lower levels of these hormones and promote relaxation.

**Recommendations:**

* Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week.
* Children and adolescents should engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day.
* If you are new to exercise, start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time.

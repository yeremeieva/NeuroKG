**Title:** Brain texture as a marker of transdiagnostic clinical profiles in patients with recent-onset psychosis and depression

**Background:**
Mental health diagnoses are often based on symptom clusters, but recent research suggests that transdiagnostic approaches may be more helpful in understanding and treating mental illness. This study investigates whether structural brain changes can characterize transdiagnostic clinical profiles in recent-onset psychosis (ROP) and depression (ROD).

**Methods:**
Researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to extract texture feature maps from the brains of 116 patients with ROD, 122 patients with ROP, and 197 healthy controls. They then used a deep-learning algorithm to identify brain regions that contributed most to the classification of ROD and ROP patients.

**Results:**
The study found that a specific texture feature, called the contrast feature map, accurately distinguished between ROP and ROD patients and healthy controls, with an accuracy of 72.43%. The voxels that contributed most to this classification were located in the cerebellum, anterior and posterior midline areas, frontotemporal areas, and right insula.

**Clustering Analysis:**
The researchers then performed clustering analysis on the contrast feature maps to identify homogeneous groups of patients. They identified eight clusters, each with a unique pattern of brain alterations and clinical symptom profiles. Some clusters showed high positive, negative, or depressive symptoms, while others showed functional deficits or symptom improvement over time.

**Relevance to Clinical Outcomes:**
The researchers also found that the contrast feature map predicted clinical outcomes, such as age, severity of symptoms, and changes in functionality. Specifically, higher contrast values in certain brain regions were associated with improved functionality and reductions in negative symptoms.

**Conclusion:**
The study provides evidence for the utility of brain texture markers in transdiagnostically characterizing ROP and ROD, and in predicting clinical outcomes. The findings suggest that structural brain changes may be a marker of transdiagnostic psychopathology and could inform the development of more personalized and targeted treatments.

**Additional Key Points:**

* The study used a large sample size and an independent validation sample to ensure the robustness of the findings.
* The researchers emphasize the importance of considering transdiagnostic approaches to mental health diagnosis and treatment.
* They suggest that brain texture markers could potentially be used to identify patients who are at risk for certain symptoms or outcomes, and to tailor treatment accordingly.

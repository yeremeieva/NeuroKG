**Summary of the Scientific Paper**

**Objective:** To systematically review and synthesize qualitative research studies examining Parkinson's disease patients' experiences with deep brain stimulation (DBS).

**Methods:** Meta-ethnography of 7 original qualitative studies, using meta-ethnography.

**Participants:** 116 patients with Parkinson's disease who had undergone DBS and 9 spouses of patients.

**Results:**

* **Pre-surgery:** Patients experience significant loss and loss of control, with high hopes for DBS.
* **Post-surgery:** Many experience euphoria, but this does not persist and significant transitions are required.
* **Normality:** A core concept in the experience of DBS, representing a pre-disease state or an adjusted life accommodating the disease.
* **Control:** Loss of control precludes normality, making it a key condition for normality.
* **Transitions:** Patients and spouses undergo physical, functional, social, psychological, and relationship transitions to adjust to post-DBS life.
* **Hopes:** Pre-DBS hopes influence expectations and transitions, but reconciliation with post-DBS reality may be necessary.

**Conclusions:**

* Further qualitative research is needed to understand the nature of post-DBS transitions.
* Healthcare professionals should consider concepts like normality and control when assessing DBS outcomes.
* Longer-term follow-up studies on DBS outcomes are required.

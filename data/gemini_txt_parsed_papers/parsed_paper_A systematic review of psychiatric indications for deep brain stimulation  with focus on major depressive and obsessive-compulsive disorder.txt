In this review, the authors describe the placement of electrodes and the surgical procedure of deep brain stimulation (DBS). They explain that DBS is a treatment that can be used for addressing a variety of psychiatric disorders, but it has shown to be the most effective in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In addition, DBS has also been used in treating Touretteâ€™s disorder, anorexia nervosa, and substance abuse.

There is promising evidence suggesting that DBS can improve treatment-resistant OCD and MDD. However, the authors emphasize that results from the current research are limited due to small sample size and insufficient randomized controlled data. Nevertheless, DBS for OCD has received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The authors conclude that DBS may have potential for treating treatment-resistant OCD and MDD, but more research is needed using larger sample sizes and randomized controlled studies.

This paper published in Nature Communications is a study on the natural history of long-COVID in a nationwide, population cohort study. It had two primary aims:
1. To describe the trajectory of long-COVID symptoms and recovery status over time
2. To compare the changes in symptoms and recovery status in people with a previous symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with those who had never been infected. 

A total of 345,673 questionnaires were sent out, and 288,173 individuals completed at least one questionnaire. Of these, 257,341 (89%) consented to record linkage, required to obtain their test result. Following linkage, 53,530 were excluded because they reported a previous positive test that was not recorded on the database, 5687 because they had asymptomatic infections, and 37,343 because they were recruited beyond 6 months follow-up. Of the remaining 160,781 individuals, 80,332 (50%) had previous symptomatic, laboratory-conﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 80,449 (50%) had never had a positive test for SARS-CoV2 infection. Of the 80,332 people who had previous symptomatic infections, 12,947 have so far completed questionnaires at both 6- and 12-month follow-up and 4196 have completed questionnaires at both 6- and 18-month follow-up. The corresponding ﬁgures for the 80,449 individuals never infected were 11,026 and 1711, respectively. 

Overall, the results showed that long-COVID was a stable condition in many, but both improvement and deterioration occurred in others. Improvements in altered taste, smell and confusion were reassuring. In contrast, the findings of late-onset cough and hearing problems one year following infection, that could not be explained by background trends or confounding, merit further investigation.

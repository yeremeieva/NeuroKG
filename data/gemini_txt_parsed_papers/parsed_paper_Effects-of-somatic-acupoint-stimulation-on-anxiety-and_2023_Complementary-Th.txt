This systematic review provides the latest research evidence to support SAS as a promising intervention for alleviating anxiety and depression in cancer patients. However, the research evidence should be interpreted prudently as methodological concerns were identified in some included studies, and some sub-group analyses were performed with a relatively small sample size. More rigorously designed large-scale RCTs with placebo-controlled comparisons are warranted to generate high-quality evidence.

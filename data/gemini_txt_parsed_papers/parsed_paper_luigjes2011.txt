**Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Addiction: Review of Potential Brain Targets**

**Introduction**
* DBS is a surgical intervention that uses implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to brain areas.
* DBS is being investigated as a treatment for addiction, as it has shown promising results in treating other psychiatric disorders.

**Animal Studies**
* Seven animal studies have investigated DBS effects on addiction-related behaviors, targeting six brain areas:
    * Nucleus accumbens (NAc)
    * Subthalamic nucleus (STN)
    * Dorsal striatum
    * Lateral habenula
    * Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
    * Lateral hypothalamus
* High-frequency DBS of the NAc and mPFC showed the most robust effects in reducing drug-seeking behavior and consumption.

**Human Case Studies**
* Eleven human case studies have reported DBS effects on addiction, targeting two areas:
    * NAc (5 studies)
    * STN (6 studies)
* NAc DBS led to remission of addiction in several cases, while STN DBS results were mixed, with some cases showing improvement and others worsening.

**Most Promising Target Area: NAc**
* The NAc is the most frequently studied target area and has consistently shown promising results in both animal research and human case studies.
* NAc DBS may normalize striatal dysfunction and/or modulate neuronal network activity to reduce craving and increase the salience of natural reinforcers.

**Possible Mechanisms of Action**
* DBS may:
    * Normalize dysfunction in striatal areas, reducing craving and increasing the relative salience of natural reinforcers.
    * Activate afferent and efferent pathways, modulating dysfunctional neuronal network activity.
* DBS effects on monoamine neurotransmitters in the target area and other brain regions are still being investigated.

**Conclusion**
* NAc DBS is currently the most promising candidate target for therapy-refractory addiction.
* Further research is needed to:
    * Confirm the efficacy and safety of NAc DBS in clinical trials.
    * Explore the mechanisms of action and identify the optimal stimulation parameters.
* More research on other target areas, such as the mPFC, is also warranted.

**Deep Brain Stimulation: Neuropsychological and Neuropsychiatric Issues**

**Background:**
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment option for Parkinson's disease, effectively improving motor symptoms but raising concerns about potential cognitive and neuropsychiatric effects.

**Outcomes:**
**Cognitive Outcomes:**
- Subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation: Generally benign, with reports of mild cognitive decline in some patients
- Globus pallidus interna (GPi) stimulation: Less frequent cognitive changes reported
- Ventrointeromedial nucleus of the thalamus (Vim) stimulation: Minimal cognitive impact observed

**Neuropsychiatric Outcomes:**
- STN stimulation: Transient confusion, hypomania, emotional reactivity, suicide attempts/suicides, depression, apathy, hallucinations
- GPi stimulation: Fewer reported psychiatric symptoms, but depression and apathy observed
- Vim stimulation: Rare psychiatric complications

**Methodological Issues:**
- Small sample sizes and limited power in many studies
- Lack of control groups makes it difficult to determine whether changes are due to DBS or other factors

**Pathophysiology:**
- Changes in dopaminergic medications
- Direct effects of stimulation on brain structures involved in cognition and behavior
- Underlying neurodegenerative processes

**Management:**
- Preoperative assessment of cognitive and psychiatric status
- Optimization of dopaminergic medications
- Close monitoring and management of psychiatric symptoms
- Multidisciplinary team approach involving neurologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists

**Postoperative Management of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease After Deep Brain Stimulation**

**General Management Aspects**

**Early Postoperative Management**

* Routine postoperative care is sufficient in most cases.
* Start antiparkinsonian medication as soon as possible to reduce discomfort and prevent dopaminergic withdrawal.
* Consider atypical antipsychotics for postoperative confusion or agitation.
* Neuroimaging is recommended after surgery to confirm electrode position and rule out complications.

**Initiation of Programming**

* Timing varies depending on individual factors and center practices.
* May be delayed until symptoms return and microlesioning effects wear off.
* Assessments typically focus on rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, and gait instability.

**Optimization of Stimulation Parameters**

* Use a screening session to determine the optimal contact and stimulation settings.
* Consider the hierarchy of contacts and stimulation polarity.
* Adjust parameters (amplitude, pulse width, frequency) to achieve symptom control and avoid side effects.

**Follow-Up Care**

* Patients should be trained to adjust stimulation parameters if possible.
* Follow-up visits and telephone contacts should be scheduled according to patient needs and available resources.
* Routine OFF stimulation assessments are not necessary, but may be considered in specific circumstances.

**Management of Common Postoperative Problems**

**Weight Gain**

* A common occurrence, especially after STN DBS.
* Provide nutritional counseling preoperatively.
* Weight gain may normalize over time.

**Dyskinesias**

* STN DBS may initially trigger dyskinesias, which usually disappear with chronic stimulation.
* GPi DBS exerts an antidyskinetic effect.
* Reduce dopaminergic medication to minimize dyskinesias.

**Axial Symptoms**

* Deterioration of axial symptoms can occur after STN, GPi, and Vim DBS.
* Optimize stimulation parameters and medication to improve axial symptoms.
* Declines in axial symptoms with chronic stimulation are likely due to disease progression.

**Speech Dysfunction**

* Speech disorders are common after STN DBS and Vim DBS, but less so after GPi DBS.
* Reduce stimulation amplitude or use bipolar configuration to alleviate speech difficulties.
* Supportive measures may be necessary for patients with preoperative speech problems or disease-related deterioration.

**Muscle Contractions**

* Tonic muscle contractions can occur with suprathreshold stimulation parameters.
* Reduce stimulation amplitude or focus the electrical field to minimize contractions.

**Long-Term Complications**

* Infections, erosions, loss of efficacy, intermittent stimulation, tolerance, and pain or discomfort can develop.
* Monitor for and manage these complications promptly.

**Other Considerations**

* Social and job-related factors, dementia, general medical issues, and lifestyle changes should be addressed.
* Collaboration between neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, neuropsychiatrists, and researchers is essential for optimal patient management.

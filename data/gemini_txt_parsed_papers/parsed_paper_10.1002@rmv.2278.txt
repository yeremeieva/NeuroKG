**Impact of Parkinson's Disease on COVID-19 Outcomes**

**Summary:**

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The analysis included 13 studies with a total of 8649 PD patients and 88710 control subjects.

**Key Findings:**

* **Prevalence of COVID-19:** The pooled prevalence rate of COVID-19 in PD patients was 2.12%, with significant heterogeneity among studies.
* **Symptoms:** Fever, cough, fatigue, and anorexia were the most common symptoms in PD patients with COVID-19.
* **Hospitalization and ICU Admission:** The pooled rate of hospitalization was 39.89%, and the pooled rate of ICU admission was 4.7%.
* **Mortality:** The pooled mortality rate was 25.1%, with significant heterogeneity among studies.
* **Comparison with COVID-19 Patients without PD:** There were no significant differences in hospitalization or mortality rates between PD patients with COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients without PD.

**Conclusions:**

* The prevalence and prognosis of COVID-19 seem comparable in patients with PD and those without it.
* The increased hospitalizations and mortality may be attributed to old age and comorbidities.

**Limitations:**

* The heterogeneity among studies may have influenced the results.
* The included studies were observational, limiting the ability to establish causality.

**Implications:**

* PD patients should be aware of the potential risks of COVID-19 and take appropriate precautions.
* Healthcare providers should be vigilant in monitoring PD patients for COVID-19 symptoms and providing timely treatment.
* Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the potential association between PD and COVID-19 severity.

**Summary**

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well established treatment for movement disorders that donâ€™t respond well to medications. However, DBS therapy is complex and requires a high level of clinical expertise, and treatment failures can occur due to improper patient selection, incorrect placement of stimulating electrodes, poor programming, or inadequate post-operative balancing between stimulation and medication. 

Research in recent years has focused on how the pathophysiology of movement disorders and the physiological mechanisms of DBS translate into a therapy that can be tailored to meet the individual needs of patients, reduce the need for extensive clinical programming, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

There have been very limited advancements in neurostimulation devices despite the success of DBS in clinical treatment for movement disorders and psychiatric conditions, epilepsy, and pain. However, recently, with new competitors in the market, there has been a competitive race for technical device innovation. These innovations provide physicians with more flexible programming options (e.g., Vercise; Boston Scientific, Valencia, CA) or clinical research tools (e.g., ACTIVA PC 1S, Medtronic; Minneapolis, MN) to validate neurophysiological concepts of neurostimulation in clinical practice.

DBS mechanisms are varied and complex, and several hypotheses have been postulated over the years. However, it is believed that DBS modulates pathological activity within central neural networks with applied electric fields, and that one fundamental effect of DBS is the stimulation of axons around the electrode. 

DBS electrodes are surrounded by thousands of different axons that may project to or from the area of implantation or simply pass by. The electric field generated by DBS polarizes all axons that are sufficiently close to the stimulating electrodes, resulting in action potentials traveling orthodromically and antidromically along the axon.

DBS has also offered a unique opportunity to directly record multiunit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) from deep brain targets that are otherwise inaccessible. These recordings have helped better define disease-specific and symptom-specific network activity in the thalamus-cortex basal ganglia-cortex network.

DBS electrodes are surrounded by thousands of different axons, which can project to or from the area of implantation or simply pass by on their way to a different brain region. The electric field generated by DBS polarizes all of the axons that are sufficiently close to the stimulating electrodes, resulting in action potentials traveling orthodromically and antidromically along the axon.

New concepts that have emerged from research emphasize the role of firing patterns and synchronized oscillatory activity within the thalamus-cortex basal ganglia-cortex network. 

DBS has also offered the unique opportunity to directly record multiunit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) from deep brain targets that are otherwise inaccessible and has helped to define the nature of this disease-specific (or symptom-specific) network activity.

DBS is an effective treatment for movement disorders, but there are several translational needs for technological innovation of DBS in order to improve consistency of good DBS outcomes by compensating for variable lead placements within the subthalamic area (STN). These needs include:

1.	Directional Deep Brain Stimulation
2.	Novel Pulse Parameters
3.	Computational Models of Deep Brain Stimulation
4.	Identification of Symptom- or Disease-Specific Physiomarkers
5.	Novel Stimulation Patterns Selectively Suppressing Disease-Specific Brain Activity
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
There are several new innovations in DBS methodologies that have recently been introduced. These include:

1.	Segmentation of electrodes has been proposed to enable fine-tuning of stimulation fields and reduce side effects.
2.	Closed-loop stimulation involves the use of a variety of physiological signals to automatically adjust stimulation parameters.
3.	Computational modeling can be used to predict the effects of DBS before it is performed, and to optimize stimulation parameters.
4.	Novel stimulation patterns, such as coordinated reset stimulation, have been shown to be effective in animal models of movement disorders.

By combining these new methodologies, it may be possible to improve the efficacy and safety of DBS for movement disorders and other neurological conditions.

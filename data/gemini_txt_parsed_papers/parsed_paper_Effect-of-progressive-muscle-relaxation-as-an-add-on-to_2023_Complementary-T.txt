This study investigated the effects of pulmonary telerehabilitation (PTR) combined with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on the physical and psychological outcomes of discharged patients with COVID-19. 
Discharged COVID-19 patients (n=58) were randomly assigned to two groups: PTR with PMR (experimental group) and PTR alone (comparison group). The experimental group underwent a six-week intervention of PTR and PMR, while the comparison group received only PTR. 
The primary outcome was functional capacity, assessed by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes included dyspnea, fatigue, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and health status. 
Results showed no significant difference between the groups in functional capacity. 
However, the experimental group experienced significantly lower fatigue (p=0.041) and anxiety (p=0.001), and significantly improved sleep quality (p=0.001) compared to the comparison group. 
PTR combined with PMR effectively reduced fatigue and anxiety and improved sleep quality in discharged COVID-19 patients compared to PTR alone. This combination can be considered as an effective intervention for these patients. 
Limitations include the lack of a group that only received PMR, failure to investigate factors such as psychological conditions, diet, family support, and the home environment, and عدم پیگیری بیماران برای تعیین اثرات طولانی مدت.

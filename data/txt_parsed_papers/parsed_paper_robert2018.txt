The study examines the development of research on Parkinson's disease from 1983 to 2017, focusing on the distribution by countries and journals. The analysis, which sourced data from the Science Citation Index-Expanded database of the Web of Science, spans seven five-year intervals: 1983-1987 through 2013-2017. Over these 35 years, the number of research papers on Parkinson's disease saw a 33-fold increase, from 885 papers in the earliest interval to 29,972 in the latest. Concurrently, the number of countries contributing to Parkinson's disease research expanded from 37 to 131, with the United States consistently leading in research output. Throughout the period, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, and Australia also contributed significantly. From 2003 onwards, Asian countries like China, South Korea, India, and Turkey began to show rapid increases in publication volume. By the 2013-2017 period, China had become the second-largest contributor to Parkinson's disease research globally. Despite an increase in African countries participating in Parkinson's disease research (from 4 to 22), most contributed five or fewer papers in each five-year period.

Additionally, the study found a 12-fold increase in the number of journals publishing research on Parkinson's disease, from 232 to 2,824. Three journals dedicated to Parkinson's disease (Parkinsonism & Related Disorders, Movement Disorders, and Journal of Parkinson's Disease) accounted for 6.8% of all papers in the field during the 2013-2017 period. However, a large majority (82.5%) of journals published ten or fewer papers on the topic. This quantitative analysis complements existing qualitative reviews, providing a global perspective on Parkinson's disease research.

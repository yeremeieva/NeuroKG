This study examines the development of the scientific literature on Parkinson's disease from 1983 to 2017, providing insights for scientists, physicians, patients, caregivers, and policymakers involved with Parkinson's disease. The research sourced articles from journals listed in the Science Citation Index-Expanded database of the Web of Science, analyzing publications across seven five-year intervals: 1983-1987 through 2013-2017. Over 35 years, the number of research papers on Parkinson's disease surged 33-fold, from 885 papers in the earliest period to 29,972 in the latest. Concurrently, the number of countries contributing to Parkinson's disease research expanded from 37 to 131. The United States consistently led in research output, followed by several European (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and France) and English-speaking countries (Canada and Australia). From 2003, Asian countries like China, South Korea, India, and Turkey significantly increased their publication output on Parkinson's disease. By the period 2013-2017, China had moved up to rank second globally in research productivity, trailing only the United States. Despite an increase from 4 to 22 African countries engaging in Parkinson's disease research between 1983 and 2017, most were either unproductive or contributed five or fewer papers in each five-year interval. The study also found a 12-fold increase in the number of journals (from 232 to 2,824) publishing papers on Parkinson's disease. In the latest period analyzed, three journals focused on Parkinson's disease ("Parkinsonism & Related Disorders," "Movement Disorders," and "Journal of Parkinson's Disease") accounted for 6.8% of all Parkinson's disease papers, while a vast majority (82.5%) of journals published ten or fewer papers on the subject. This quantitative analysis provides a comprehensive global overview of Parkinson's disease research, complementing existing qualitative reviews.

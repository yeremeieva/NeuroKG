Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. These cells are crucial for regulating movement, and their depletion leads to the characteristic motor symptoms of Parkinson's. Research suggests that the disease starts to develop years before these motor symptoms appear, manifesting in non-motor symptoms that could potentially serve as early indicators of the disease. This study presents a machine learning-based approach to diagnose Parkinson's disease early by analyzing voice features. The method integrates feature selection and classification techniques, employing Feature Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection, and using Classification and Regression Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines for classification. Among these, the combination of Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination showed superior performance, achieving a 93.84% accuracy rate with the fewest voice features for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease.

Parkinson's disease gradually progresses, leading to the loss of brain cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for coordinating body movements. The earliest symptoms of Parkinson's manifest in the nervous system and can include a reduced sense of smell, sleep disturbances, and constipation, before progressing to more noticeable motor symptoms. Researchers are focusing on identifying these early non-motor symptoms to halt the disease's progression. Machine learning has become a vital tool in diagnosing medical conditions, including Parkinson's, due to its high accuracy and ease of implementation. Various studies have applied machine learning to predict Parkinson's disease using data from voice recordings, motion sensors, and even handwriting, aiming for early diagnosis through less invasive and cost-effective methods.

This study used a dataset from the National Center for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, consisting of biomedical voice measurements from individuals with and without Parkinson's. Feature selection was conducted to identify the most relevant voice features for diagnosis, significantly improving the classification accuracy and reducing computational effort. The study demonstrated that machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines combined with Recursive Feature Elimination, could effectively diagnose Parkinson's disease early by analyzing a minimal set of voice features, offering a promising tool for early intervention and treatment planning.

Machine learning algorithms have been applied to facilitate the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, which arises due to the malfunction of brain cells responsible for producing dopamine, a substance vital for brain cells to communicate effectively. This disruption affects movement control, adaptation, and fluency. The disease's onset predates the emergence of motor symptoms by many years, leading to research into recognizing early non-motor symptoms to prevent disease progression.

This study introduces a machine learning-based approach for diagnosing Parkinson's disease, incorporating feature selection and classification steps. Methods such as Feature Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination are employed for selecting relevant features, while Classification and Regression Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines are utilized for classifying patients. The combination of Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination outperformed other methods, achieving a 93.84% accuracy with a minimal number of voice features.

Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative condition that leads to the loss of brain cells, particularly those producing dopamine in certain brain regions. Early symptoms include disturbances in smell, sleep, and bowel movements, followed by motor symptoms like tremor and slowed movements. Vocal impairments are present in 90% of patients, underscoring the importance of early symptom recognition.

Machine learning has become increasingly popular in medical diagnoses due to its high accuracy and ease of implementation. It has been applied to various aspects of Parkinson's disease management, from feature selection in brain surgery to predicting cognitive outcomes and tremor levels. Early diagnosis efforts have focused on analyzing motion data, voice signals, and even handwriting, utilizing a range of machine learning classifiers and feature selection methods to improve diagnostic accuracy.

This paper employed a dataset of voice measurements from 31 individuals, including both Parkinson's patients and a control group, to develop a diagnosis model. Feature selection was crucial in identifying the most relevant features for efficient classification. Various classifiers were tested, with Support Vector Machines combined with Recursive Feature Elimination showing the best performance.

In conclusion, machine learning, specifically Support Vector Machines paired with Recursive Feature Elimination, demonstrates significant potential in diagnosing Parkinson's disease early through the analysis of voice features. This approach offers a promising direction for reducing computational costs and improving diagnostic accuracy, highlighting the importance of machine learning in advancing medical diagnostics.

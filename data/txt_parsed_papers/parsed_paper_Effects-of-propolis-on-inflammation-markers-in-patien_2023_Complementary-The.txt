The effects of propolis on inflammation markers in patients undergoing hemodialysis were studied through a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial. The research was focused on individuals with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, a treatment associated with various risk factors for cardiovascular diseases due to factors like oxidative stress and inflammation. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of propolis supplementation, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, on inflammatory markers in these patients.

In the methodology, participants were divided into two groups: one received propolis capsules (400 mg/day of concentrated and standardized dry green propolis extract), and the other received placebo capsules for two months. Plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines were assessed to determine the effects of the supplementation.

The results indicated that propolis supplementation significantly reduced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and showed a tendency to lower macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta levels, suggesting that propolis might help mitigate inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. The study highlighted the potential benefits of propolis in reducing inflammatory markers, contributing to the management of chronic kidney disease complications.

A systematic review was conducted to investigate the use of deep brain stimulation for psychiatric conditions, particularly focusing on major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This treatment method, which involves the surgical implantation of electrodes in specific brain regions to modulate neural activity, has shown promise for patients with these disorders who have not responded to traditional therapies.

Deep brain stimulation has been explored for various psychiatric conditions with the majority of research centered around major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. For major depressive disorder, targets for stimulation included the subcallosal cingulate gyrus, nucleus accumbens, inferior thalamic peduncle, ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum, lateral habenula, and the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle. These studies involved a total of 100 patients, demonstrating varying degrees of effectiveness, with some patients achieving response or remission from depressive symptoms.

For obsessive-compulsive disorder, deep brain stimulation targets included the ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens, subthalamic nucleus, internal capsule, inferior thalamic peduncle, and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, across 18 studies involving 112 patients. The results suggested potential benefits of deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder, with some patients experiencing significant reductions in symptoms.

The review found that deep brain stimulation may hold promise for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, though the evidence is limited by the small size of the studies and the lack of randomized controlled trial data. For obsessive-compulsive disorder, deep brain stimulation has received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration. Other psychiatric applications are currently considered experimental.

The procedure for deep brain stimulation involves a surgical operation where electrodes are implanted in the brain, connected via extension cables to a neurostimulator device placed under the skin. Programming of the device post-surgery aims to optimize treatment effects while minimizing side effects, which can include ocular disturbances, dysarthria, paresthesia, sweating, and hypomania, depending on the stimulation target.

Complications from the surgery are relatively rare but can include infections, hardware malfunctions, and in some cases, intracerebral hemorrhages. Stimulation-induced side effects vary by target area but are generally reversible by adjusting the stimulation settings.

This systematic review underscores the potential of deep brain stimulation as a therapeutic option for certain psychiatric conditions, highlighting the need for further research to establish its efficacy and safety across a broader range of disorders.

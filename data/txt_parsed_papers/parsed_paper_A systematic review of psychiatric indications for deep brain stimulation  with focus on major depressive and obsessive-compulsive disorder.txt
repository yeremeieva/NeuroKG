This article provides a systematic review of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for psychiatric disorders, with a particular focus on major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). DBS is a surgical treatment involving the implantation of electrodes within certain areas of the brain. These electrodes produce electrical impulses that regulate abnormal impulses. The review highlights that DBS has shown promising results for patients with therapy-refractory OCD and MDD. It outlines the methodology, patient characteristics, treatment results, and adverse effects associated with DBS.

For MDD, the review analyzes studies targeting areas such as the subcallosal cingulate gyrus, nucleus accumbens, inferior thalamic peduncle, ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum, lateral habenula, and the medial forebrain bundle. It concludes that DBS may offer hope for treatment-resistant MDD but emphasizes the need for more extensive randomized controlled data to support this.

Regarding OCD, the review covers studies on DBS targeting the nucleus accumbens, ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum, subthalamic nucleus, internal capsule, inferior thalamic peduncle, and bed nucleus of stria terminalis. It suggests that DBS for OCD, which has received FDA approval as a "humanitarian device exemption," shows promise but is still considered experimental and should be conducted in clinical trials by experienced multidisciplinary teams.

The review also briefly mentions DBS for other psychiatric disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, anorexia nervosa, and substance use disorders, stating that while promising, DBS for these conditions is highly experimental.

In conclusion, the review posits that DBS is a safe method with relatively few serious complications and highlights the reversibility of stimulation-induced side effects as an advantage. However, it calls for more standardized and extensive research to better understand the efficacy, safety, and optimal targets for DBS in treating psychiatric disorders.

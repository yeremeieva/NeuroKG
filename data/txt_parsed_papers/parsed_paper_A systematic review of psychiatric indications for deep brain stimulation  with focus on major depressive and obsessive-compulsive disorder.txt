A systematic review was conducted to explore the use of deep brain stimulation as a treatment for psychiatric disorders, particularly focusing on major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This review included a thorough search in MEDLINE to identify relevant studies. A total of 52 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion, representing 286 patients who received deep brain stimulation for various psychiatric conditions. The review primarily centered on major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, with 18 studies discussing 112 patients treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder across six different brain targets, and nine studies involving 100 patients treated for major depressive disorder across five different targets.

Deep brain stimulation has shown promising outcomes for individuals with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder, although the evidence is limited by the small size of study samples and a lack of sufficient randomized controlled trial data. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, treatments for other psychiatric conditions are still considered experimental.

The review found that the surgical procedure involves placing electrodes in specific areas of the brain, connected to a neurostimulator device. This device delivers electrical impulses to the targeted brain regions. The exact mechanisms by which deep brain stimulation affects psychiatric conditions are not fully understood, but it is believed to involve changes in neuronal activity and brain metabolism.

Complications from the procedure were generally minor, with the most common being infection and hardware malfunction. Stimulation-induced side effects varied depending on the target area but were typically reversible by adjusting the stimulation settings. There were instances of suicide and suicide attempts reported, but these were not directly attributed to the deep brain stimulation treatment.

In summary, while deep brain stimulation offers hope for individuals with certain treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, further research is necessary to fully understand its efficacy and safety profile.

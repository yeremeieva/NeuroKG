Recent advancements have showcased a significant growth in innovative methods aimed at enhancing the assessment of Parkinson's disease through technology in various settings including laboratories, clinics, and homes. This surge in novel assessment methods has not been fully evaluated in terms of their development stage, practicality, and effectiveness in evaluating the primary features of Parkinson's disease.

A comprehensive review of literature spanning a decade was conducted to evaluate these new assessment methods. A total of 9,503 publications were initially identified, of which 848 full papers were closely examined, and 588 original articles were assessed for technological aspects, demographic details, clinimetric properties, and readiness for technology transfer.

The findings revealed that a majority of the studies involved less than 30 patients, less than half utilized a standardized methodology for validating diagnostic tests, only 8% confirmed their results using a different dataset, and 87% were conducted in clinical or laboratory settings. The domain of axial features was the most frequently studied, followed by bradykinesia, while rigidity and non-motor domains were less commonly explored. Only 6% of the systems reviewed showed a level of technological readiness that suggests they could be incorporated into clinical assessments in the foreseeable future.

This systematic evaluation offers a detailed overview of the current quantitative assessment options for Parkinson's disease and what might be expected in the near future. There is a pressing need for standardized and collaborative studies to confirm preliminary findings, explore under-researched domains, and validate existing and emerging technologies more effectively.

Recent years have seen exponential growth in innovative methods for Parkinson's disease assessment using various technologies. Wearable sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, smartphones, and an array of electronic systems have been employed to capture physiological signals related to both motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease. Despite the long history of some of these technologies, their recent application to Parkinson's disease assessment represents a novel approach.

This systematic review provides a comprehensive evaluation of these new assessment methods investigated over the past ten years. The review highlights the need for further research and development in this field, particularly in standardizing assessment methods, exploring less studied domains, and validating new technologies for clinical use. The findings underscore the potential of these technologies to revolutionize the assessment of Parkinson's disease, offering more objective and precise measurement tools that can enhance diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate treatment efficacy.

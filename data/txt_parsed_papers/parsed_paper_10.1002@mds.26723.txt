Recent Developments in Parkinson’s Disease Assessment Methods: A Systematic Review from 2005 to 2015

Abstract: The last ten years have seen significant growth in new methods aimed at enhancing the assessment of Parkinson’s disease through technology in laboratory, clinical, and home settings. The current state of these new assessment methods of Parkinson’s disease using technology in terms of their maturity, feasibility, and utility in assessing the main features of Parkinson’s disease has not been systematically reviewed.

Methods: A systematic review of literature from 2005 to 2015 was carried out. Out of 9,503 publications found in PubMed and the Web of Science, 848 full papers were evaluated, and 588 original articles were reviewed to assess the technological, demographic, clinimetric, and technology transfer readiness parameters of these new assessment methods.

Results: It was found that 65% of the studies included fewer than 30 patients, less than 50% used a standard methodology to validate diagnostic tests, 8% confirmed their results in a different dataset, and 87% were conducted in a clinic or lab setting. The axial features domain was the most frequently studied, followed by bradykinesia. Rigidity and non-motor domains were rarely investigated. Only 6% of the systems reached a technology level that justified the hope of being included in clinical assessments within a useful time period.

Conclusions: This systematic review provides an overview of the current options for quantitative assessment of Parkinson’s disease and what can be expected in the near future. There is a particular need for standardized and collaborative studies to confirm the results of preliminary initiatives, assess domains that are currently under-investigated, and better validate the existing and upcoming new assessment methods using technology.

Recent years have witnessed a surge in new methods designed to enhance the assessment of Parkinson’s disease through various technologies. These include wearable sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, smartphones, and various electronic systems used to collect physiological signals related to the motor and non-motor aspects of the disease. Though some technologies are not new, their recent application in the context of Parkinson’s disease represents a growing interest in providing objective measures of the disease’s attributes.

This systematic review offers a thorough evaluation of the new assessment methods investigated over the past ten years, highlighting the technologies employed, the focus on motor versus non-motor symptoms, and the readiness level of these technologies for clinical application. A systematic search for articles published within the specified timeframe was conducted in electronic databases, resulting in the evaluation of numerous studies focusing on the technological aspects, demographic profiles, and clinimetric properties associated with these new assessment methods.

The review found that a significant proportion of studies involved small patient populations and often did not employ standardized validation methodologies. The axial features and bradykinesia were among the most studied motor symptoms, while rigidity and non-motor symptoms received less attention. Only a small percentage of the technologies reviewed were deemed ready for inclusion in clinical settings in the near future.

This evaluation underscores the need for more standardized and collaborative research efforts to validate these new assessment methods and expand the investigation into less studied domains of Parkinson’s disease. The review aims to provide clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the current state of technology-based assessments of Parkinson’s disease and the potential advancements expected in the coming years.

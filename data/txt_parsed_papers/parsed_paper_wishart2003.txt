Deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides a non-destructive alternative to thalamotomy for the surgical management of drug-resistant tremor in multiple sclerosis. Despite its potential, there is a scarcity of reported outcomes for this treatment modality. This paper aims to systematically review existing literature on the application of deep brain stimulation in multiple sclerosis and add case reports from our own experience.

Deep brain stimulation has been primarily targeted at the ventrointeromedial nucleus of the thalamus in the majority of the 75 reported cases. Most patients achieved tremor reduction and improved daily functioning, with 87.7% showing some level of sustained improvement in tremor control after surgery. Improvement in daily activities was reported in 76.0% of cases where such data were available. The side effects observed were similar to those seen in populations undergoing deep brain stimulation for other conditions.

However, the reviewed studies often lacked standardized quantitative outcome measures and typically had follow-up periods of one year or less. Despite these limitations, the evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation can frequently improve tremor control in individuals with multiple sclerosis. It is important to note that while complete tremor cessation may not always be achieved, tremor control might decrease over time for some patients, and periodic reprogramming of the device might be necessary to maintain optimal outcomes.

Multiple sclerosis-related tremor can significantly affect the arms, legs, trunk, and head, with the upper extremities being the most commonly impacted. The action tremor in multiple sclerosis may involve postural or kinetic components and can affect both proximal and distal parts of the forearm. The underlying cause is thought to be related to cerebellum dysfunction or its connections, although further research is needed. Medical management often proves unsatisfactory, and while ablative thalamotomy has been effective for some, it may not provide lasting benefits.

In our case series, we present additional patients who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation implantation. These cases demonstrate significant improvements in tremor control and daily functioning post-surgery, albeit with the necessity for ongoing reprogramming to maintain optimal tremor control. In some instances, tremor control diminished over time, but patients continued to experience benefits compared to their pre-surgical state.

In conclusion, deep brain stimulation represents a promising treatment option for tremor in multiple sclerosis, offering the possibility of improved tremor control and enhanced daily functioning. However, the variability in outcomes and the need for regular device reprogramming highlight the importance of further research to optimize patient selection and treatment protocols.

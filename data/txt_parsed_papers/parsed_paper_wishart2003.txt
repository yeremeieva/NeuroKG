Deep brain stimulation is considered a non-ablative alternative to thalamotomy for surgically treating drug-resistant tremor in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Despite its potential, there has been a shortage of reported outcomes on its effectiveness.

This document aims to systematically review available cases of deep brain stimulation use in multiple sclerosis and introduce four additional patient cases. A combination of quantitative and qualitative review methods was used, alongside presenting a case series from a specific medical center.

The review found that the majority of the 75 reported cases targeted the ventrointeromedial nucleus of the thalamus for DBS implantation. Most patients achieved tremor reduction and improvements in daily functioning, with approximately 87.7% showing sustained tremor control improvement after surgery. The impact on daily functioning was not as consistently reported across studies, but in those that did, about 76.0% of patients reported improvements. Adverse effects were similar to those observed in Deep brain stimulation treatments for other conditions.

However, the reviewed studies often lacked standardized quantitative outcome measures and typically had follow-up periods of a year or less. Despite these limitations, the data suggest that chronic Deep brain stimulation can lead to improved tremor control in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Complete tremor cessation is not always achieved, tremor control may decrease over time for some, and frequent reprogramming of the DBS device may be necessary.

Multiple sclerosis is known to cause tremor in various parts of the body, with the upper extremities being the most affected. Medical treatments for tremor in multiple sclerosis are often unsatisfactory, and while ablative thalamotomy has been effective in some cases, its benefits might not be long-lasting. Deep brain stimulation, by providing electrical stimulation through implanted electrodes, offers an alternative treatment method. This procedure has been used in the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease and essential tremor, prompting its application in multiple sclerosis cases as well.

The literature search identified 14 full reports on DBS in multiple sclerosis, all contributing relevant data to the review. The studies varied in size and followed patients for differing lengths of time, typically between three months to more than a year. Each study was examined for its selection criteria, surgical target, primary outcome variables including tremor suppression, improvement in daily functioning, and adverse effects.

In conclusion, while Deep brain stimulation often leads to improved tremor control in multiple sclerosis, the complete cessation of tremor is not always possible, with some cases experiencing a decrease in tremor control over time. The necessity for frequent reprogramming of the device was noted, and future studies could benefit from more standardized measures of outcome and longer follow-up periods to better assess the long-term efficacy and safety of DBS in treating multiple sclerosis-related tremor.

This paper, published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry in 2003 by H.A. Wishart and colleagues, focuses on the use of chronic Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for tremor in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The study provides a systematic review of published cases of DBS use in MS and presents four additional case reports from their center.

DBS is highlighted as a non-ablative alternative to thalamotomy for the treatment of medically refractory tremor in MS. Despite the limited number of reported outcomes, the results from the majority of cases (n=75) reviewed showed that tremor reduction and improvement in daily functioning were achieved in most patients. Specifically, 87.7% of patients experienced at least some sustained improvement in tremor control post-surgery. Moreover, effects on daily functioning were less consistently assessed across studies; however, in those reporting relevant data, 76.0% of patients experienced improvement in daily functioning.

The review further discusses the surgical procedure, emphasizing that the ventrointeromedial nucleus of the thalamus was the most common surgical target for DBS implantation in MS patients. The paper also touches on the adverse effects, which were similar to those reported for DBS in other patient populations, including neurological and psychiatric side effects.

A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to discussing the outcomes and effectiveness of DBS in MS patients. The review acknowledges the limitations in the studies reviewed, particularly the use of non-standardized quantitative outcome measures and the generally short follow-up periods. Nevertheless, the compiled data suggest chronic DBS often results in improved tremor control in MS, although complete cessation of tremor is not always achieved, and tremor control may decrease over time.

The authors conclude by emphasizing the need for further studies with more standardized outcome measures and longer follow-up periods to better assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of DBS in the treatment of tremor in MS patients.

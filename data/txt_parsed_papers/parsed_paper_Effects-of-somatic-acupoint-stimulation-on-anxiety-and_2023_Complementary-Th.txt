This study aimed to explore the effects of somatic acupoint stimulation (SAS) on anxiety and depression in cancer patients by conducting an updated systematic review of randomized controlled trials. A comprehensive search of thirteen electronic databases was performed up until August 2022, focusing on studies that investigated the effects of SAS on anxiety and/or depression in cancer patients. Both meta-analysis and descriptive analysis were used to assess the outcomes.

A total of twenty-eight studies were included in the review, comprising twenty-two journal articles and six ongoing registered clinical trials. The overall methodological quality and evidence level of the studies were found to be suboptimal, with no high-quality evidence identified. Moderate evidence indicated that SAS could significantly decrease anxiety in cancer patients, with significant results shown for both acupuncture and acupressure. As for depression, the data analysis suggested that SAS could significantly decrease depression levels, although the evidence was rated as low. No statistically significant difference was found between true and sham acupoint stimulation for both anxiety and depression.

The review concluded that SAS appears to be a promising intervention for alleviating anxiety and depression in cancer patients. However, due to methodological concerns in some included studies and relatively small sample sizes in some sub-group analyses, the research evidence should be interpreted with caution. The review recommends that more rigorously designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with placebo-controlled comparisons are needed to generate high-quality evidence.

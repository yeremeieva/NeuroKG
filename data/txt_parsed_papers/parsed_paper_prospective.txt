Deep Brain Stimulation: Management After Surgery

Managing a patient with Parkinson's disease after they have undergone deep brain stimulation is a complex process that requires careful consideration of numerous factors. This includes decisions on when to start programming the device, how to evaluate the effects of the stimulation, and how to adjust the stimulation and medication for optimal patient outcomes. Additionally, follow-up care, patient education on self-adjusting stimulation, scheduling of follow-up visits, and handling of postoperative complications must be meticulously planned. This comprehensive approach is necessary to address potential postoperative issues such as weight gain, speech dysfunction, muscle contractions, visual disturbances, and behavioral or cognitive problems, as well as long-term complications like infection, loss of effect, and pain. It is also essential to consider the patient's social, job-related, and lifestyle changes post-surgery.

Methods of evaluating and optimizing stimulation parameters involve a systematic approach that includes assessing the immediate effects on symptoms like rigidity and tremor, and fine-tuning the device settings based on these observations. The process typically follows a two-stage assessment to identify the optimal electrode contact by evaluating both the efficacy and side effects of stimulation at different contacts. Once the ideal contact is selected, medication dosages can be adjusted accordingly, especially in the case of subthalamic nucleus stimulation, where a balance between stimulation effects and medication reduction is crucial.

Patients should be educated on how to manage their stimulation device, including turning it on and off and checking its status. The frequency of follow-up visits and the necessity of telephone contacts with healthcare providers are determined based on individual needs and the resources available at the treating center. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor device functionality, manage ongoing Parkinson's disease symptoms, and address any new health issues that may arise.

It is recognized that there is a variety of management approaches across different centers, which does not seem to affect patient outcomes significantly. This flexibility allows for adjustments based on available resources, patient needs, and the expertise of the healthcare team. Future research could focus on developing standardized postoperative management algorithms and evaluating their cost-effectiveness to further improve patient care after deep brain stimulation.

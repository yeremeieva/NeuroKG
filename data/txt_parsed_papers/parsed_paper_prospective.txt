Deep Brain Stimulation: Postoperative Issues

Management of a patient with Parkinson's disease after deep brain stimulation is multifaceted and involves numerous considerations. Decisions regarding when to start programming, conducting a programming screen, evaluating the effects of programming, and adjusting both stimulation and medication for each targeted site are critical. Follow-up care, including patient adjustments of stimulation, scheduling of follow-up visits, telephone contact, and conditions during follow-up assessments, need to be established. Additionally, a plan for managing potential postoperative problems such as weight gain, dyskinesia, axial symptoms, speech dysfunction, muscle contractions, paresthesia, eyelid, ocular and visual disturbances, as well as behavioral and cognitive issues should be developed. Managing long-term complications like infection or erosion, loss of effect, intermittent stimulation, tolerance, and pain or discomfort is also necessary. Consideration of social and job-related factors, the development of dementia, general medical issues, and lifestyle changes is important. This report aims to provide answers to a series of questions developed to address all aspects of postoperative management and decision-making for Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation, with a systematic overview of the literature and expert opinions. The report has received endorsements from relevant scientific and clinical bodies.

General Management Aspects:
- Postoperative treatment should resume as soon as possible to alleviate discomfort and limit the risk of acute dopaminergic withdrawal. Standard postoperative care includes systemic administration of antibiotics and standard monitoring.
- Programming initiation timing varies among centers, balancing the need to alleviate symptoms with waiting for microlesioning effects to subside.
- Initial programming involves assessing stimulation effects with a focus on rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, and gait instability. Optimal electrode contact is selected based on efficacy and side effects.
- Patients may be trained to adjust stimulation parameters within set limits, enhancing symptom control and allowing for nocturnal battery sparing.

Follow-Up and Long-Term Management:
- Regular follow-up visits are recommended, customized according to individual needs. Patients require ongoing monitoring for device functioning, battery life, and overall Parkinson's disease management.
- Managing common postoperative issues involves specific strategies for weight gain, dyskinesias, axial symptoms, speech dysfunction, and other potential complications.
- Long-term complications requiring neurosurgical attention include infections, sudden loss of efficacy, and pain following implantation.

The comprehensive management plan outlined seeks to address the complex needs of Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation, emphasizing individualized care and ongoing monitoring to optimize outcomes.

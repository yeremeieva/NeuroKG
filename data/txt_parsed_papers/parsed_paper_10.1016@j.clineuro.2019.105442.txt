Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, has been increasingly utilized in the diagnostics, monitoring, and management of neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. This is due to the complex nature of these disorders, which often present similarly in their early stages, making diagnosis challenging. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of artificial intelligence, through machine learning algorithms, in the kinematic analysis of movement disorders, with a specific focus on Parkinson's disease. We examined studies from various online databases that used machine learning algorithms to diagnose and assess Parkinson's disease based on data describing the motion of both upper and lower extremities. This systematic review discusses 48 studies that demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence in diagnostics, therapy assessment, and progress prediction in Parkinson's disease, based on body kinematics. These studies highlight the promising results of different machine learning algorithms, especially for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and the potential of collecting data from widely available devices. However, for the full potential of artificial intelligence technologies to be realized in the future, greater collaboration among medical institutions, clinicians, and researchers is recommended to standardize data collection protocols and facilitate data sharing.

In healthcare, artificial intelligence, including wearable sensors and other advanced technologies, has shown significant potential in improving diagnostics, disease management, and outcome prediction. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, employs powerful algorithms that allow systems to find patterns within data, classify, and predict outcomes through learning from experience. This approach has been applied to neurodegenerative movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, where early and reliable diagnosis is crucial. Machine learning algorithms, coupled with wearable devices, have addressed various challenges in this area.

For assisting diagnostics, machine learning algorithms have significantly improved the differentiation between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls compared to traditional clinical diagnosis. These algorithms have been applied to data obtained from simple devices like computer keyboards, smartphones, and video cameras, analyzing tasks such as finger tapping and tremor assessment. Studies report high classification accuracy between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls, especially for more advanced stages of the disease and larger datasets.

In terms of disease monitoring and therapy assessment, machine learning has been used to objectively evaluate motor symptoms and disease severity based on standard clinical tests. This includes cloud-based mobile applications that allow remote recording of tasks and intelligent algorithms for automatic detection of patients' conditions and daily activities. Machine learning approaches have shown great potential in increasing the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of clinical decision-making and assessment.

Advanced algorithms have also been applied to the development of new diagnostic systems based on the motion of lower extremities, focusing on early diagnosis, prediction of motor symptoms affecting normal walking, and assessment of therapy response. Wearable sensors, infrared cameras, and force sensors have been utilized to collect data for machine learning analysis, demonstrating high accuracy in diagnosing Parkinson's disease and detecting symptoms such as freezing of gait.

Overall, the implementation of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing and assessing Parkinson's disease shows promising results, with the potential for widespread application through affordable and globally available devices. Further collaboration and standardization in data collection and sharing are necessary to fully leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence technologies in the future.

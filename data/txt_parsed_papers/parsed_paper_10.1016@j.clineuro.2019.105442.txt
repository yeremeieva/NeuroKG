Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, plays a significant role in the computer-aided diagnosis, monitoring, and management of neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. This is especially challenging due to the high variability between individuals and the similarity in clinical presentations of different disorders at early stages. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the use of artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms in the kinematic analysis of movement disorders, with a focus on Parkinson's disease. The review considered papers published within a specified period, exploring the use of machine learning algorithms for the diagnosis and assessment of Parkinson's disease using data describing the motion of upper and lower extremities.

The study highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms in improving the diagnostics of Parkinson's disease, particularly in its early stages. It showcases the use of affordable and globally available devices in data collection, suggesting that with broader collaboration among medical institutions, clinicians, and researchers, the full potential of artificial intelligence technologies could be realized.

The review also discusses the application of machine learning in healthcare, particularly in neurology, where it has helped address challenges related to neurodegenerative movement disorders. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms coupled with wearable devices for disease diagnosis, management, and monitoring.

Furthermore, the review outlines various studies that have applied machine learning algorithms to kinematic datasets acquired from patients with Parkinson's disease. These studies have explored diagnostics, disease monitoring, and kinematic assessment using different algorithms and devices, including standard computer keyboards, smartphones, electromagnetic sensors, and wearable inertial sensors.

The review emphasizes the significance of machine learning in providing diagnostic support, assessing therapeutic effects, and monitoring motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. It also highlights the importance of objective assessment of symptoms and disease severity based on standardized motor tasks, which could lead to more efficient and personalized treatment plans.

Additionally, the review discusses the use of machine learning in detecting and predicting movement-related issues such as freezing of gait and falls, and in assessing the severity of gait disturbances. It indicates the role of wearable and camera-based systems in fall detection and the potential of machine learning methods in improving prediction rates.

In conclusion, the review underscores the promising results of using machine learning algorithms for the diagnosis and assessment of Parkinson's disease, based on kinematic data from different body parts. It suggests that with continued research and collaboration, machine learning could significantly enhance the diagnosis, assessment, and management of Parkinson's disease, making treatment more personalized and effective.

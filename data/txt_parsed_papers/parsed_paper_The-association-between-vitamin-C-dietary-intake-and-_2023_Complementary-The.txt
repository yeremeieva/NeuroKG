The relationship between dietary vitamin C intake and serum levels with anthropometric indices such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference was explored through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This study aimed to investigate the association of vitamin C consumption and its levels in the blood with weight-related measures.

A comprehensive search was conducted in various databases including Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, up until the end of August 2021. The search focused on observational studies that examined the relationship between vitamin C intake or levels in the blood with BMI and waist circumference in adults. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the quality assessment tool provided by the National Institute of Health.

Out of 11,689 studies identified, 47 were included in the systematic review, and 37 made it to the meta-analysis. The results highlighted a significant inverse correlation between waist circumference and serum vitamin C levels, as well as between BMI and serum vitamin C levels. It was found that higher consumption of vitamin C was significantly associated with lower BMI. No significant differences in serum vitamin C levels were observed between individuals of normal weight and those who were overweight. However, obese individuals had significantly higher serum vitamin C levels compared to those of normal weight.

The findings suggest that both dietary intake and serum levels of vitamin C are inversely related to BMI and waist circumference. Further well-designed clinical trials are necessary to examine the potential of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention and treatment of obesity.

Weight disorders are linked to non-communicable diseases and have seen a dramatic increase in prevalence over the past few decades. Overweight and obesity are associated with various complications such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, negatively impacting the quality of life. Factors contributing to weight disorders include genetics, environment, socioeconomic status, and nutritional status.

An association between overweight/obesity and increased inflammatory markers has been observed. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) play a crucial role in the development of obesity and its complications, suggesting that antioxidant agents like carotenoids, vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc, magnesium, and selenium might have protective effects against the adverse outcomes of obesity and overweight.

Vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin, performs several functions including wound healing, iron absorption, collagen synthesis, and hemoglobin activation. It acts as a powerful electron donor, scavenging harmful free radicals, and has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions.

The relationship between dietary or serum vitamin C and anthropometric indices has been studied in various populations, but results have been inconsistent. Some studies found no significant differences in serum vitamin C levels among individuals of different weight categories, while others reported significant associations. Discrepancies in findings could be due to differences in study sample sizes, regions, nutritional status, and genetic factors. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the association between dietary and circulating vitamin C levels and anthropometric indices further.

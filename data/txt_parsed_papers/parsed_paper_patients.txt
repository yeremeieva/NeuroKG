The document you've shared appears to be a comprehensive systematic review and synthesis on "Patients’ experiences of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson’s disease." Authored by Mathers J, Rick C, Jenkinson C, et al., and published in BMJ Open in 2016, the study aims to review and synthesize qualitative research studies exploring patients' experiences with DBS in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).

Key Points from the Document:

1. **Objective and Design**: The study systematically reviewed and meta-synthesized seven original papers using metaethnography, focusing on patients' experiences of DBS in advanced Parkinson's disease. The studies were conducted in Denmark, France, and Sweden, involving 116 patients who had undergone DBS and 9 spouses of patients.

2. **Findings Prior to DBS**: Before undergoing DBS, patients experienced significant loss and a feeling of loss of control due to advancing PD. There were high hopes for what DBS could bring to their lives.

3. **Post-DBS Experiences**: After surgery, many patients described a sense of euphoria, which did not persist, indicating a need for significant transitions post-surgery. The concept of "normality" and regaining a sense of control were core to the experience of DBS. The study highlights that the experience of DBS for both patients and spouses, and the transitions they must undertake, are influenced by their hopes of what surgery could achieve or regain, aiming for a "new normality."

4. **Conclusions**: The authors emphasize the need for further qualitative research to understand the transitions experienced by patients and their spouses post-DBS, to inform healthcare professionals on how best to support them. The study suggests that when assessing outcomes of DBS and other treatments in advanced PD, holistic concepts such as normality and control should be considered, and that longer-term follow-up studies are necessary.

5. **Strengths and Limitations**: The study is recognized as the first review and synthesis of qualitative research examining patients' experiences of DBS for PD, identifying core overarching concepts that enhance understanding of DBS experiences. However, it also notes limitations, including the inclusion of two papers of low quality based on methodological reporting but conceptually rich, and the fact that only seven qualitative studies focusing on the experience of DBS have been undertaken to date.

This systematic review and synthesis provide valuable insights into the complex experiences of patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson's disease, highlighting the significance of understanding and supporting the emotional and psychological transitions that accompany the surgical intervention.

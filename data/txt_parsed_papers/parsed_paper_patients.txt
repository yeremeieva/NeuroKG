To summarize and synthesize qualitative research studies focusing on patients' experiences with deep brain stimulation in advanced Parkinson's disease, a systematic review and meta-synthesis of seven original studies were conducted using metaethnography. These studies were carried out in Denmark, France, and Sweden and included 116 patients who had undergone deep brain stimulation and 9 spouses of patients.

Before undergoing surgery, patients with advancing Parkinson's disease experience significant losses and a diminishing sense of control due to the disease's progression. The anticipation of surgery is filled with significant hopes for improvement. After the surgery, many describe an initial euphoria, which is followed by a period of adjustment to a new state of health and life. This analysis highlights the concept of "normality" and the importance of control as central to the experiences of deep brain stimulation for both patients and their spouses. The transitions experienced by patients and their spouses are shaped by their expectations of what the surgery could achieve or restore, suggesting a pursuit of a "new normality."

The need for further qualitative research to understand these transitions is emphasized to better support patients and their spouses through healthcare interventions before, during, and after deep brain stimulation. When evaluating the outcomes of deep brain stimulation and other treatments for advanced Parkinson's disease, it is suggested that holistic concepts such as normality and control should be considered. Additionally, studies examining the outcomes of deep brain stimulation should include longer-term follow-up to capture the full range of patient experiences.

Deep brain stimulation has shown effectiveness in improving many motor and some non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, not all patients report improvements in quality of life after the procedure. This highlights the variability and sometimes negative assessments of quality of life by patients and spouses soon after the surgery, despite its overall effectiveness.

The analysis of deep brain stimulation experiences and the identified core themes underline the complex and individual nature of living with and treating advanced Parkinson's disease. Understanding these experiences in depth can inform healthcare practices and support mechanisms for patients undergoing deep brain stimulation and their families.

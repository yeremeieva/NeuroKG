Most patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 experience lingering physical and psychological symptoms. This study explored the impact of combining pulmonary telerehabilitation with progressive muscle relaxation on the well-being of patients who had been discharged after COVID-19. In a hospital setting, discharged patients between the ages of 18-65 were randomly divided into two groups. One group received both pulmonary telerehabilitation and progressive muscle relaxation over six weeks, while the other group received only pulmonary telerehabilitation. The study assessed primary outcomes like functional capacity and secondary outcomes including shortness of breath, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep quality, and life quality before and after the intervention.

The group that received both therapies showed significantly better sleep quality and lower levels of fatigue and anxiety compared to the group that received pulmonary telerehabilitation alone. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of other outcomes. The results suggest that adding progressive muscle relaxation to pulmonary telerehabilitation could be more effective in improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety and fatigue among COVID-19 survivors.

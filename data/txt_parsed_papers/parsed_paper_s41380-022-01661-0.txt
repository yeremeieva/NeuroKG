The serotonin hypothesis of depression, which suggests that depression is linked to reduced serotonin levels or activity, remains influential. This comprehensive review aimed to evaluate and synthesize evidence regarding the association between depression and serotonin levels or activity. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO up to December 2020 to identify systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large data-set analyses covering various research areas related to serotonin. These areas included serotonin and serotonin metabolite concentrations in body fluids, serotonin receptor binding, serotonin transporter levels, tryptophan depletion studies, serotonin transporter gene associations, and serotonin transporter gene-environment interactions. Studies focusing on depression associated with physical conditions or specific subtypes of depression were excluded.

Seventeen studies were included in the analysis, consisting of twelve systematic reviews and meta-analyses, one collaborative meta-analysis, one meta-analysis of large cohort studies, one systematic review and narrative synthesis, one genetic association study, and one umbrella review. The quality of the reviews varied, with some genetic studies being of high quality. The evidence reviewed did not consistently support an association between serotonin levels or activity and depression, nor did it support the hypothesis that depression is caused by reduced serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence suggested the possibility that long-term use of antidepressants might reduce serotonin concentration.

This review also outlined the methods used for selecting studies, including criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and the approach for data extraction and quality assessment. The findings indicate that the main areas of serotonin research do not consistently support the serotonin hypothesis of depression.

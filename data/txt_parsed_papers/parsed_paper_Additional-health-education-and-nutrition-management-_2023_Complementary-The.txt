Additional health education and nutrition management result in greater weight loss compared to concurrent training alone in overweight young females. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of concurrent training and the addition of health education and nutrition management on body composition and health-related outcomes in young females who are overweight. Twenty-four healthy overweight females, aged approximately 20 years with a body mass index indicating overweight, were divided into two groups. Both groups participated in an 8-week program of concurrent training six days per week. However, one group also received health education and controlled their daily energy intake to match their basal metabolic rate.

After the intervention, both groups exhibited improvements in body composition, with reductions in body mass, total fat mass, and body fat percentage. However, the group that also received health education and nutrition management experienced significantly greater reductions in these areas. Additionally, both groups saw improvements in serum glucose, lipids, insulin, and progesterone levels without significant differences between the groups.

In conclusion, concurrent training effectively reduces fat mass and improves metabolic health markers in the short term. The inclusion of health education and nutrition management leads to greater weight loss and fat reduction, suggesting it could be a more effective method for obesity treatment.

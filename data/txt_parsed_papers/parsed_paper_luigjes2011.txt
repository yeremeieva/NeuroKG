Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an adjustable, reversible, non-destructive neurosurgical intervention utilizing implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to specific areas in the brain. It is being researched within psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and depressive disorder. Recent studies in both animals and humans have shown that DBS could be an effective treatment for patients with treatment-resistant addiction, though it is not fully clear which brain areas should be targeted. This review aims to provide a systematic overview of the literature on DBS and addiction and to identify the most promising brain targets based on efficacy and adverse event data from preclinical and clinical studies. Seven animal studies targeting six different brain areas were found: nucleus accumbens, subthalamic nucleus, dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus. Additionally, eleven human studies focusing on two different areas: nucleus accumbens and subthalamic nucleus were identified. The nucleus accumbens emerges as the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-resistant addiction. The medial prefrontal cortex is another promising target but requires further exploration to determine its clinical suitability. The review concludes by discussing translational issues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations, and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in addiction patients.

Deep brain stimulation is a neurosurgical intervention where implanted electrodes deliver electrical pulses to target areas of the brain. This method has been used for over two decades to treat movement disorders and has shown promise in treating psychiatric disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and depressive disorder. Interest in DBS as a treatment for addiction is growing due to promising preclinical and case study results, a better understanding of neural pathways affected in addiction, and the need for effective treatments for patients unresponsive to current therapies. Addiction, a chronic relapsing brain disorder, severely impacts individual and public health, with many patients experiencing multiple relapses despite treatment.

Understanding the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of DBS for treating addiction requires identifying the most promising brain target areas. This review examines published empirical studies on DBS in addiction in animals and humans, focusing on effects on addiction-related behaviors and side effects. In animal studies, seven investigations explored the effects of DBS on addiction models using six target areas. The nucleus accumbens was the most studied target, showing significant reductions in drug-related behaviors without apparent side effects. Other areas like the subthalamic nucleus and lateral habenula were also explored, each showing varying degrees of effectiveness and side effects. In humans, studies have primarily focused on the nucleus accumbens and subthalamic nucleus, with the nucleus accumbens showing promising results in reducing drug consumption and addiction behaviors.

The review highlights the nucleus accumbens as the most promising target for DBS in treating addiction, with the medial prefrontal cortex also showing potential. Future research should continue to explore these and other target areas to fully understand the potential of DBS in treating addiction. The review ends by discussing the importance of careful target area selection, ethical considerations, and the need for well-designed clinical trials to advance the application of DBS in addiction treatment.

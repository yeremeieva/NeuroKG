This comprehensive review by Luigjes et al. (2012) in Molecular Psychiatry delves into the potential of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for addiction, specifically focusing on identifying the most promising brain targets for this intervention. The review is thorough, systematically examining both preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in various brain regions associated with addiction. 

DBS, a reversible and adjustable neurosurgical method that involves delivering electrical pulses to specific brain areas, has shown promise in treating several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome, and depression. Given the chronic nature of addiction and the limited success of current treatments for a significant portion of patients, exploring DBS as a potential treatment for addiction is both timely and crucial.

The review identifies the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as the most promising target for DBS in the treatment of addiction, based on the analysis of seven animal studies targeting six different brain areas and 11 human studies focusing on the NAc and subthalamic nucleus (STN). The NAc, implicated in the brain's reward circuitry, showed consistent reductions in addiction-related behaviors in animal models and decreased drug intake in human case reports without significant adverse effects. This evidence supports the NAc as a viable target for further exploration in DBS treatment for addiction.

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is also mentioned as a potential target, although further research is needed to establish its efficacy and safety for clinical use. The authors also highlight the need for more preclinical studies on other promising brain regions, such as the insula and cingulate cortex, which have been implicated in addiction but have not yet been explored as DBS targets.

Translational issues, including the differences in DBS application between animals and humans and the need for careful patient selection and ethical considerations, are discussed. The review concludes with recommendations for carefully designed clinical trials to explore NAc DBS in treating treatment-resistant addiction, emphasizing the importance of adhering to medical ethical standards.

Overall, this review by Luigjes et al. is an important contribution to the field of addiction research, offering a systematic and critical evaluation of the potential of DBS as a novel treatment approach. It sets the stage for future research to explore the therapeutic possibilities of DBS in addiction, potentially offering hope to patients for whom current treatments have been ineffective.

Deep brain stimulation  is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the implantation of electrodes in specific areas of the brain to deliver electrical pulses. It has been used as a treatment for movement disorders for over two decades and has shown promising results as an experimental treatment for psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and depressive disorder. Recently, Deep brain stimulation has been investigated as a potential treatment for addiction, a chronic relapsing brain disorder that significantly impacts individual and public health. Despite several treatment attempts, a substantial number of patients experience multiple relapses and a chronic course of the disorder, with abstinence rates after one year of completing treatment ranging from 30% to 50%.

This review aims to provide a systematic overview of the literature on Deep brain stimulation and addiction, focusing on the most promising brain targets based on efficacy and adverse event data from preclinical and clinical studies. The review found seven animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens, subthalamic nucleus, dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, and eleven human studies targeting two different areas: nucleus accumbens and subthalamic nucleus. The analysis suggests that the nucleus accumbens is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, while the medial prefrontal cortex also shows promise but requires further exploration.

Animal studies have investigated the effects of DBS on addiction models using various substances, including ethanol, cocaine, and morphine. The findings suggest that high-frequency Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens attenuates drug-related behavior in rats without apparent side effects. Other studies explored the effects of Deep brain stimulation on the subthalamic nucleus, dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, with varying results regarding efficacy and side effects.

The review concludes with a discussion on translational issues in Deep brain stimulation research, medical ethical considerations, and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in patients with addiction. The identification of effective and safe target areas for DBS in addiction treatment is crucial for investigating its feasibility and potential as a therapeutic option for patients who do not benefit from current treatments.

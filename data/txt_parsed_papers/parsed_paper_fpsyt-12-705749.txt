Depression has emerged as a significant threat to global health, prompting researchers worldwide to delve into understanding and addressing this condition. The global landscape of depression research is vast and complex, necessitating a comprehensive analysis to identify current research distributions, hotspots, frontiers, and trends. This study sets out to create a knowledge map of depression research, utilizing bibliometric and data visualization techniques to examine various aspects including country, journal, category, author, institution, cited article, and keyword dimensions. By establishing a relationship network of depression research, the study highlights the most influential entities in these areas, aiming to uncover the field's research potential, guide future collaborations, and systematically present the current state and gaps in depression research.

Depression, also known as major depressive disorder, clinical depression, or melancholia, is a debilitating mental illness that significantly affects mood. It is highly prevalent, with more than 350 million people affected worldwide according to recent statistics, marking an 18% increase over the last decade. This makes depression a leading cause of disability and a major contributor to the global burden of disease.

The study of depression has attracted considerable scientific interest, leading to a significant body of research. However, bibliometric studies specifically focused on depression are relatively scarce. This research aims to fill that gap by offering a thorough bibliometric analysis and data visualization of depression research from 2004 to 2019. The analysis includes cooperative networks and co-presentation analysis, based on thousands of papers from the core collection database, providing insights into collaborative networks, key trends, and emerging research areas in the field of depression.

The study reveals that depression research is a global endeavor, with contributions from numerous countries. The United States stands out as a leader in the field, contributing to a significant portion of the research output. Other notable contributors include countries from Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania. The analysis indicates that depression research is not only widespread but also highly collaborative, with various nations participating in a global research network.

In terms of research trends, the study identifies several growth periods in depression research output, highlighting years of sharp growth as well as periods of slower progress. The analysis also differentiates between research contributions from developed and developing countries, showcasing the global nature of depression research efforts.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the landscape of depression research, identifying key contributors, trends, and areas for future exploration. It underscores the importance of continued research and collaboration in addressing the global challenge of depression, offering a roadmap for researchers and institutions looking to contribute to this critical field of study.

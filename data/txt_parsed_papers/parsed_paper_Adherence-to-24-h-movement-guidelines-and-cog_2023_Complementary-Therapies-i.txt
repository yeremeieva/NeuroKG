Studies have highlighted sleep, screen time, and physical activity as independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in adolescents. This study investigated the association between adherence to 24-hour movement guidelines and cognitive difficulties in adolescents, using data from the Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance. Participants reported their screen time, sleep, and physical activity levels, and cognitive difficulty was assessed with a yes or no response. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association, with results reported as odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval.

The findings showed that compared to adolescents not adhering to any of the guidelines, those adhering to the screen time and sleep guidelines were more likely to report no cognitive difficulties, respectively. Adhering to all the guidelines also increased the likelihood of reporting no cognitive difficulties.

These findings suggest that promoting better 24-hour movement behaviors could be an effective approach to reducing cognitive difficulties in adolescents. Future studies should use enhanced study designs to further investigate these results.

Minor lapses in attention, memory, and psychomotor coordination are common in individuals facing daily cognitive challenges. Cognitive failure is usually due to temporary errors rather than a general deficiency. There is a lack of studies on cognitive problems, which can negatively affect quality of life. Cognitive difficulties are more common in individuals who are younger, fatigued, depressed, or show signs of certain medical conditions. Learning difficulties in children are often linked to deficits in working memory and attention, leading to a range of social and emotional issues.

This study used data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which tracks various health behaviors among high school students. Physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration were measured through self-reported questionnaires. Cognitive difficulty was assessed with a single question regarding difficulties in concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.

The results showed that adhering to sleep and screen time guidelines was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of reporting no cognitive difficulties. Adhering to all three guidelines was strongly associated with having no cognitive difficulties, suggesting the importance of a balanced approach to physical activity, screen time, and sleep in reducing cognitive difficulties in adolescents.

The study acknowledges limitations due to its cross-sectional nature and reliance on self-reported data. Future research should use larger sample sizes and objective measures to confirm these findings and further explore the association between 24-hour movement behaviors and cognitive difficulties among adolescents.

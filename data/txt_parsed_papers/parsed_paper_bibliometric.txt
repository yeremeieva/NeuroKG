The objective of the study was to identify and examine the characteristics of the top 100 most cited papers in the field of deep brain stimulation (DBS) research. The Web of Science database was searched for papers related to DBS research. Criteria such as the number of citations, countries, institutions of origin, year of publication, and research area were recorded and analyzed.

The top 100 articles had an average of 304.15 citations each, with an average annual citation rate of 25.39. The most frequently targeted brain area in these studies was the subthalamic nucleus. These papers were published across 46 high-impact journals, with the journal Brain leading the count. The contributions came from 11 different countries, with the United States leading in terms of the number of highly-cited articles; however, the University of Toronto in Canada was the institution with the highest number of highly-cited studies.

The findings from this research provide a historical perspective on the progress in the field of DBS, highlighting the most influential reports and indicating potential areas for further investigation.

The search for highly-cited DBS-related papers was conducted using various search terms related to DBS on Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science, and the results were ranked by the number of citations. The search was performed on a specific date to minimize variations in citation numbers. Data inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed articles on DBS research that were published and indexed in the Web of Science, including original research articles and review articles. Exclusion criteria ruled out patents, books, non-biomedical publications, conference abstracts, case reports, and articles focusing on specific diseases without mentioning DBS as a potential treatment.

After identifying the top 100 most-cited articles, data such as the title, year of publication, last corresponding author and their first institution, country of origin, journal name, number of citations, type of study, research topic, and keywords were extracted from each article. Statistical analysis was performed to compare citation counts, and tools like CiteSpace were utilized to visualize trends and patterns in DBS research.

The analysis revealed that the top 100 articles were published between 1991 and 2013, with a significant peak in publications after 2002, coinciding with regulatory approvals for DBS treatments. The United States was the most frequent country of origin, but the research had a broad international representation. The articles were published in a variety of journals, with Brain, Neurology, and Journal of Neurosurgery being the most common. The research topics were diverse, with Parkinson’s disease and the subthalamic nucleus being the most common disease and target, respectively.

This bibliometric analysis provides insights into the most influential research in the field of DBS, highlighting key contributions and potential areas for future research.

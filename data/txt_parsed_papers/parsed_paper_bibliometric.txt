The objective was to identify and analyze the characteristics of the top 100 most cited papers in the field of deep brain stimulation (DBS). A search was conducted using the Web of Science for papers related to DBS research. Data such as the number of citations, countries, institutions of origin, year of publication, and research area were noted and analyzed. The top 100 articles had an average of 304.15 citations and accrued an average of 25.39 citations a year. The subthalamic nucleus was the most represented target. These articles were published across 46 high-impact journals, with the journal titled Brain topping the list. The articles came from 11 countries, with the United States contributing the most highly-cited articles; however, it was the University of Toronto in Canada that was the institution with the most highly-cited studies. This study identified the top 100 most-cited studies and provided a historical perspective on the progress in the field of DBS, highlighting the most influential reports and indicating areas requiring further investigation.

Deep brain stimulation is a neurosurgical procedure first described in the 1950s and has since become a major area for treating severe Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, among others. The exact mechanism of action of DBS remains uncertain, but it has brought dramatic and lasting benefits to patients.

The analysis of citation data has been applied to various specialties and research areas, allowing for the evaluation of the impact of scientific journals or researchers. In the field of neurosurgery, an analysis of highly-cited papers has been conducted, but little was known about the most frequently cited articles specifically related to DBS research. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the top 100 most-cited articles pertaining to DBS and related research, to reveal important contributions to the literature in this promising field.

The results showed a peak in the number of studies after the early 2000s, coinciding with the approval of specific DBS applications by the Food and Drug Administration. The analysis found that the majority of highly-cited articles originated from the United States, but a significant proportion also came from other countries, reflecting the global contribution to DBS research. The fields of most interest in DBS research were found to be Parkinson's disease and its related stimulation targets, with the subthalamic nucleus being the most preferred stimulation target.

The study concluded that DBS research has broad applicability and relevance to multiple disciplines, with neuroscientists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons all making significant contributions. Additionally, DBS offers potential for modulating the affective brain circuitry underlying some neuropsychiatric illnesses, with further research needed to better understand the mechanism of action of DBS and develop new techniques.

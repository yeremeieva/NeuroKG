A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Jihwang-eumja in treating Alzheimer's disease compared to conventional Western medications. This review included a comprehensive search across multiple databases for randomized controlled trials that compared the effects of Jihwang-eumja and Western medications on cognition and daily living activities in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias, and the GRADE system was applied to suggest the evidence level of each outcome. 

Out of 165 studies initially screened, six met the inclusion criteria for the review and meta-analysis, encompassing a total of 245 participants in the intervention group and 240 participants in the comparison group. The findings revealed that the Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly higher, and the standardized mean difference of activities of daily living was significantly improved in the Jihwang-eumja group compared to the group receiving Western medications. However, the studies included in the analysis had some concerns regarding the risk of bias, and the overall certainty of the evidence was considered moderate.

Despite the limited number of studies and the presence of high heterogeneity among them, the review supports the potential applicability of Jihwang-eumja for treating Alzheimer's disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the safety and effectiveness of Jihwang-eumja in clinical practice.

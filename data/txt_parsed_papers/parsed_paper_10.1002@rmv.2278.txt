The impact of Parkinson's disease on the manifestations and outcomes of Coronavirus disease 2019 patients was analyzed through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The study aimed to understand if individuals with Parkinson's disease who contracted Coronavirus disease 2019 experienced a decline in motor functions and if they had a higher risk for contracting the virus or had worse outcomes. A systematic search was conducted through seven electronic databases following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses statement. The analysis utilized software to calculate pooled sample sizes and their associated confidence intervals. A total of 13 studies were included in this analysis.

The pooled prevalence rate of Coronavirus disease 2019 was found to be 2.12%, with symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and anorexia being the most common. Rates of hospitalization, admission to the Intensive Care Unit, and mortality were calculated as 39.89%, 4.7%, and 25.1%, respectively. When comparing hospitalization and mortality rates among Coronavirus disease 2019 patients with and without Parkinson's disease, no significant differences were found. The study concluded that the prevalence and prognosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 patients appear comparable in individuals with Parkinson's disease and those without it, suggesting that increased hospitalization and mortality may be attributed to old age and co-morbidities rather than Parkinson's disease itself.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of Parkinson's disease on the manifestations and outcomes of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19). A comprehensive search was performed across seven electronic databases, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Analysis was conducted using R software, and a total of 13 studies were included in the review.

The findings revealed a pooled prevalence rate of Covid-19 among individuals with Parkinson's disease at 2.12%, with symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and anorexia being most common. Hospitalization rates were found to be 39.89%, with intensive care unit admission at 4.7% and mortality rates at 25.1%. There were no significant differences in hospitalization and mortality rates between Covid-19 patients with and without Parkinson's disease.

The review concluded that the prevalence and prognosis of Covid-19 in individuals with Parkinson's disease appear comparable to those without Parkinson's disease. Increased rates of hospitalization and mortality may be attributed to age and co-morbidities rather than Parkinson's disease itself.

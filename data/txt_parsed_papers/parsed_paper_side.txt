Handling the Side Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation: Insights from Stimulating the Subthalamic Nucleus

Deep brain stimulation is increasingly explored as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. The ethical evaluation of this new approach heavily considers the incidence and impact of side effects. This analysis focuses on the discussion around the side effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, a standard treatment for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, based on a comprehensive review of case reports, review papers, and outcome studies from 1993 to 2009. It demonstrates how the deep brain stimulation community has progressively recognized the complexity of side effects associated with stimulating the subthalamic nucleus. The discussion then moves to the quality of studies and the methods used to assess side effects, noting that evaluations of some side effects vary among different stakeholders, complicating the ethical debate around novel treatments for diseases with psychiatric components. The lessons from subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation could inform future applications of deep brain stimulation in psychiatry.

Since the beginning of medical practice, the principle "do not harm your patient" has been central. This principle, reflected in the concept of nonmaleficence, acknowledges that harmful side effects of therapies must be weighed against their benefits. The assessment of harms and benefits becomes more challenging when considering novel therapeutic approaches with unknown side effects. Deep brain stimulation serves as an example of such an approach, with its development dating back to the early 1950s and emerging in its current form in the 1980s as an alternative for ablative surgery in movement disorders. Over time, the deep brain stimulation community has become more aware of and appreciative of the therapy's complex side effects, reflecting the maturation of the therapy.

The term "side effect" itself does not inherently guide the ethical handling of a specific therapy, so terms like "adverse events" or "sequelae" should be avoided until the negative evaluation of the side effect is clear. For assessing particular side effects, they can be classified along dimensions of predictability and evaluation. Only one type of side effect—predictable and clearly outweighing the benefits—carries a clear ethical directive that the therapy should not be applied or that research on this therapy should be halted. Thus, determining what counts as an adverse event involves both measurement and evaluation problems, entangled in the process of developing the therapy. Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease patients exemplifies this issue, as predictability of side effects for individual patients is difficult, evaluations of some side effects significantly differ among patients, relatives, and physicians, and both the disease and alternative therapeutic approaches may involve similar effects to those of deep brain stimulation.

This investigation, based on an extensive analysis of research literature on deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus, covers a wide range of discussions and demonstrates a growing awareness of the main affective, behavioral, and cognitive side effects of deep brain stimulation since the early 2000s. Quality of studies and the methods used to capture "relevant" side effects, those reflecting serious ethical issues, are also examined. The analysis reveals a broad range of study qualities and indicates that while the number of high-quality studies has increased, so has the number of studies of poor quality. Yet, high-quality papers tend to be cited more often, suggesting a higher appreciation for these studies within the community. Furthermore, the distribution and usage of tests to assess side effects are uneven, with more than half of all methods applied being tests regarding cognitive issues. It's notable that the perspectives represented in these tests often vary, indicating differing evaluations of side effects among stakeholders.

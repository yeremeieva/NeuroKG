The research focuses on the ethical evaluation of deep brain stimulation, particularly when applied to the subthalamic nucleus, a treatment primarily used for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease. The paper examines the incidence and impact of side effects based on an extensive analysis of case reports, review papers, and outcome studies ranging from 1993 to 2009. The study highlights how the deep brain stimulation community has increasingly recognized the complexity of side effects over time. The investigation delves into the quality of studies on deep brain stimulation and the methods used to assess side effects, pointing out that the quality of studies has not significantly improved over time, although high-quality studies tend to be cited more often. The paper also explores the distribution of tests used to measure side effects, revealing a focus on cognitive issues and a discrepancy between the tests used and the standards recommended in the literature. The classification of tests based on whether they result from a trained evaluator's assessment or the patient's self-assessment is crucial for understanding different perspectives on side effects, highlighting the importance of involving various stakeholders' views in the ethical analysis of novel treatments for diseases with psychiatric aspects. The lessons from deep brain stimulation applications in treating Parkinson's disease could guide future applications in psychiatry, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of side effects and study quality in the development of new therapies.

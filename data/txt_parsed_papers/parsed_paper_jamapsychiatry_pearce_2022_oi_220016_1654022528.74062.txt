The importance of physical activity is underscored by its potential role in reducing the leading cause of mental health-related disease burden: depression. The specific amount of physical activity required to mitigate the risk of depression, however, remains unclear. This study aimed to thoroughly examine and synthesize data on the relationship between varying levels of physical activity and the onset of depression in adults, drawing from prospective studies.

Information was gathered from multiple databases including PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PsycINFO, without language restrictions, up until December 2020. The analysis focused on prospective cohort studies that reported on physical activity across at least three different levels and provided risk estimates for depression in adult populations of 3,000 or more with a follow-up period of at least three years.

Data extraction was meticulous, involving independent reviewers and a two-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis to integrate the findings. This analysis estimated study-specific associations and pooled associations to evaluate the relationship between physical activity and depression.

The investigation included fifteen studies with a total of 191,130 participants, encompassing over 2 million person-years. The findings revealed an inverse curvilinear relationship between physical activity and depression, suggesting that the risk of depression decreases as physical activity increases, especially at lower levels of activity. Notably, engaging in half the recommended volume of physical activity was associated with an 18% lower risk of depression, while meeting the recommended volume of physical activity was linked to a 25% lower risk. The benefits appeared to plateau beyond certain levels of physical activity.

The analysis estimated that if less active adults were to reach the current physical activity recommendations, approximately 11.5% of depression cases could potentially be prevented. This suggests that even modest increases in physical activity could have significant mental health benefits.

In conclusion, the findings support the promotion of physical activity by health practitioners as a means to improve mental health, emphasizing that even levels of physical activity below current public health recommendations can offer substantial benefits in reducing the risk of depression.

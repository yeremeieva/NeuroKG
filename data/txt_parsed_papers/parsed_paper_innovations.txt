Deep brain stimulation is a crucial clinical approach for treating movement disorders that no longer respond well to medication. However, advancements in this field have been slow due to a lack of progress in technology and device development. Recent collaborative efforts among bioengineers, neuroscientists, and clinicians have led to a better understanding of deep brain stimulation mechanisms, paving the way for overcoming previous obstacles. This review outlines the need for methodological improvements in deep brain stimulation from a neurophysiological perspective and discusses technological innovations currently being evaluated for clinical use.

Deep brain stimulation is a recognized treatment for severe movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, tremor, and dystonia. It significantly reduces motor deficits in most patients. Despite its benefits, deep brain stimulation is complex and requires a high level of expertise, involving a multidisciplinary and multistep procedure. Failures can occur due to incorrect patient selection, electrode misplacement, poor programming, or inadequate postoperative management. Movement disorders have a highly variable clinical phenotype and symptom severity, which necessitate an individualized and dynamic treatment approach. Consequently, research has aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders and the physiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation to develop a therapy that can adapt to individual patient needs, reduce extensive clinical programming, and improve patient outcomes consistently.

Technical advancements in neurostimulation devices have been limited, despite their clinical success in treating movement disorders. Only recently has competition in the market spurred innovation, offering physicians more flexible programming options and tools for validating neurophysiological concepts in clinical practice.

This review briefly discusses current concepts of deep brain stimulation mechanisms, identifies needs for translational advancements in methodology, and describes available technical solutions that may soon transform clinical practice. Understanding the mechanisms behind deep brain stimulation is essential, as it modulates pathological activity within central neural networks. Deep brain stimulation's primary effect is the stimulation of axons around the electrode, modifying intrinsic neuronal signals within functional brain networks and potentially masking or eliminating pathological network activity.

Deep brain stimulation also allows for direct recording of multiunit activity and local field potentials from deep brain targets, aiding in defining disease-specific network activity. Emerging concepts highlight the importance of firing patterns and synchronized oscillatory activity within the thalamus-basal ganglia-cortex network. Electrodes used in deep brain stimulation are surrounded by various axons, all of which are affected by the electric field generated, leading to action potentials traveling along the axon. Understanding which target neurons are beneficial for specific deep brain stimulation indications and minimizing unintended activation of nontarget neurons is crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

The adaptability of deep brain stimulation postoperatively offers significant advantages, but the increasing complexity of new devices requires more skilled programming based on clinical experience rather than neurophysiological optimization. Recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest numerous opportunities for improving device function to selectively stimulate therapeutic target neurons efficiently. This review discusses five key areas needing technological innovation in deep brain stimulation and outlines emerging solutions for these challenges.

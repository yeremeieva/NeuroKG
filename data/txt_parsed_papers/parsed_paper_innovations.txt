Deep brain stimulation is a significant clinical technique for treating movement disorders that no longer respond well to drug management. However, its advancement has been slowed down by a lack of progress in technology and device development. Recent collaborative efforts by bioengineers, neuroscientists, and clinical practitioners have enhanced understanding of deep brain stimulation mechanisms, and solutions for overcoming translational hurdles are emerging. This discussion outlines the need for methodological advancements in deep brain stimulation from a neurophysiological standpoint and describes technological solutions currently being evaluated for clinical use soon.

Deep brain stimulation is a recognized treatment for severe movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, tremor, and dystonia, leading to substantial improvement in motor deficits for most patients. Despite its benefits, deep brain stimulation remains complex and not standardized, requiring extensive expertise and involving a multidisciplinary approach. Failures in treatment can occur due to incorrect patient selection, misplaced electrodes, poor programming, or insufficient post-operative management of stimulation and medication.

Movement disorders exhibit a highly variable clinical phenotype and symptom severity, necessitating an individualized and dynamic treatment approach. Recent research aims to translate a better understanding of movement disorder pathophysiology and deep brain stimulation physiological mechanisms into therapy that better adapts to individual patient needs, reduces extensive clinical programming, and enhances patient outcome consistency.

Technological advancements in neurostimulation devices for movement disorders have been limited, despite their clinical success and expansion to other conditions like psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, or pain. Only recently has competition introduced a push for technical innovations, providing physicians with more flexible programming options and tools for validating neurophysiological concepts in clinical practice.

This review briefly covers current concepts of deep brain stimulation mechanisms, identifies needs for translational advancements in deep brain stimulation methodology, and discusses available technical solutions that may soon alter clinical deep brain stimulation practices.

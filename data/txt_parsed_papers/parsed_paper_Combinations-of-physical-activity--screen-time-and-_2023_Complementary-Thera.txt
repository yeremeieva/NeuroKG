Combinations of physical activity, screen time, and sleep are linked to the subjective wellbeing of children. Subjective wellbeing is a crucial measure of health outcomes in children. The 24-hour movement behaviors, which include physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, and their combination, are modifiable lifestyle behaviors shown to be associated with subjective wellbeing. This study aimed to explore the relationship between adherence to the 24-hour movement guidelines and subjective wellbeing among Chinese children.

Using cross-sectional data from students in primary and secondary schools in Anhui Province, China, the analysis included a total of 1,098 participants with an average age of 11.6 years. Measurements of physical activity, screen time, sleep, and subjective wellbeing were collected through validated self-reported questionnaires. The findings suggest that adhering to the guidelines for physical activity, screen time, and sleep was associated with better subjective wellbeing, with a dose-response relationship observed between the number of guidelines met and improvements in subjective wellbeing. Although some exceptions were noted, a significant relationship was found between adherence to different combinations of the guidelines and better subjective wellbeing.

This study's results indicate that adhering to the 24-hour movement guidelines is linked to greater subjective wellbeing among Chinese children, emphasizing the importance of healthy movement behavior patterns for children's mental health and wellbeing.

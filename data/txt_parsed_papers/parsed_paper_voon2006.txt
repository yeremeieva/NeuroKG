Deep Brain Stimulation has been identified as an effective treatment for the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that presents with a range of symptoms including motor, cognitive, neuropsychiatric, autonomic, and other nonmotor issues. Despite its established efficacy in addressing motor symptoms, the impact of Deep brain stimulation on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms remains less clear. This has sparked significant clinical and pathophysiological interest.

Parkinson's disease is increasingly recognized to involve a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, ranging from cognitive disorders and mood changes (such as depression and mania) to anxiety, hallucinations, and apathy. Additionally, behaviors resulting from chronic and pulsatile administration of dopamine, known as the dopamine dysregulation syndrome, have been identified. This syndrome includes excessive and pathological use of dopaminergic medications for nonmotor purposes, as well as medication-induced hypersexuality and pathological gambling.

While bilateral Deep brain stimulation, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus, has shown significant promise in managing advanced Parkinson's disease motor symptoms, its effects on nonmotor cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are varied and less conclusive. These effects range from transient and treatable neuropsychiatric symptoms to more complex cognitive impacts, with the majority of studies focusing on stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus due to its more extensive literature.

Outcome studies on Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease have reported a range of postoperative cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms. These studies have contributed to an ongoing debate regarding the comparative neurobehavioral outcomes of subthalamic nucleus versus globus pallidus internus stimulation, with methodological issues and biases in the literature influencing perceptions of DBS-related morbidity.

The literature suggests that subthalamic nucleus Deep brain stimulation results in relatively little cognitive morbidity in well-selected patients, despite common findings of a decline in word fluency among other potential cognitive impacts. Various factors, including patient age and pre-existing cognitive impairment, may influence the risk of sustaining cognitive and neurobehavioral deficits post-DBS. However, the specific impact of these factors remains unclear.

In summary, while Deep brain stimulation offers a promising treatment for the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease, its effects on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms necessitate further research and careful patient selection and management. The majority of observed neuropsychiatric symptoms following Deep brain stimulation are transient, treatable, and potentially preventable, emphasizing the need for comprehensive preoperative and postoperative care.

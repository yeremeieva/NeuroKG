Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been recognized as an effective treatment for the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that also involves cognitive, neuropsychiatric, autonomic, and other nonmotor symptoms. The impact of DBS on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, however, is less clear and has been a focus of clinical and pathophysiological interest. This discussion aims to review the literature on the cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects of DBS for Parkinson's disease, noting that the majority of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed are transient, treatable, and potentially preventable. It covers outcome studies, methodological issues, pathophysiology, and the management of cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects and complications of DBS for Parkinson's disease.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease, ranging from cognitive disorders to mood disturbances, anxiety, hallucinations, and apathy, are thought to result from the disease's neurodegenerative process, the effects of dopaminergic medications, underlying vulnerabilities, or psychosocial factors. A notable group of behaviors termed dopamine dysregulation syndrome, characterized by pathological use of dopaminergic medications and medication-induced hypersexuality and pathological gambling, has been identified.

While the efficacy of bilateral DBS, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus, for Parkinson's disease motor symptoms is well established, its effects on nonmotor cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are less defined. The literature primarily focuses on stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus, with limited data on stimulation of the ventrointermedial nucleus of the thalamus.

Cognitive outcomes following subthalamic nucleus DBS suggest relatively little cognitive morbidity in well-selected patients, though most studies suffer from small sample sizes and lack of control groups. A consistent finding across studies is a decline in word fluency, with other studies reporting declines in verbal memory, associative learning, visuospatial memory, processing speed, and executive function. Certain patient subgroups, such as older patients or those with moderate cognitive impairment prior to surgery, may be at greater risk for cognitive and neurobehavioral deficits.

The development of dementia in a small number of patients after DBS has been attributed to the progression of Parkinson's disease rather than the surgery itself. Most studies exclude patients with pre-existing dementia, and thus there are no large-scale data on the impact of DBS on cognitive function in these patients.

Overall, the literature indicates that, in well-selected patients, DBS can be effective and safe for treating Parkinson's disease, with most postoperative psychiatric symptoms being transient and manageable. Further research is needed to better understand the cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes of DBS and to optimize preoperative and postoperative management strategies.

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for neuromodulation has become a common procedure, yet the incidence of seizures or epilepsy following this treatment remains unclear. This study seeks to estimate these complications for conditions such as movement disorders, pain, and psychiatric conditions. A review of the literature was conducted, focusing on clinical case series of DBS, where a total of thirty-two papers were analyzed. These papers described the stereotactic placement of DBS electrodes for various conditions, with a study population of at least 45 individuals in each. Out of these papers, sixteen did not report on seizures as a complication, making it unclear whether seizures had occurred in those cases. The remaining sixteen papers, which accounted for at least 2101 electrode placements in 1555 patients, reported seizures in 42 patients, indicating an incidence rate of 2.7%. The incidence of seizures varied widely across the studies, from 0% in some to as high as 10% and 13% in others. The reasons for this variance were not apparent from the data. The majority of seizures, about 74%, occurred around the time of electrode implantation, and many of these patients also experienced intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up times across the studies varied, ranging from six months to five years. The analysis suggests that the risk of seizures associated with DBS placement is likely lower than 2.4%, with the risk of post-procedural seizures associated with chronic deep brain stimulation being even lower, around 0.5%. This study highlights the need for more consistent reporting on complications like seizures to better understand the risks associated with DBS for neuromodulation.

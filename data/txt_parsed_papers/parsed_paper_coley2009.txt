This article investigates the incidence of seizures following the implantation of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) electrodes for treating movement disorders, pain, and psychiatric conditions. DBS is a common neuromodulation technique, but there is limited information on the risk of seizure or epilepsy as a procedural or chronic complication.

The study conducted a literature review, focusing on clinical case series of DBS, and analyzed 32 papers that reported on stereotactic placement of DBS electrodes for the specified conditions in cohorts of at least 45 patients. Sixteen of these papers did not mention seizures as a complication, making it unclear whether seizures occurred in those cases. The other 16 papers, covering at least 2,101 electrode placements in 1,555 patients, reported seizures in 42 patients, resulting in an incidence rate of 2.7%. The incidence varied significantly across studies, ranging from 0% to as high as 13%. The variance in incidence rates was not clearly explained in the paper.

The study found that the majority (at least 74%) of seizures occurred around the time of electrode implantation, and in many cases, these patients also suffered intracranial hemorrhage. The follow-up times in the studies varied from 6 months to 5 years. The analysis was complicated by multiple publications from some centers, which might have led to data duplication. After adjusting for potential duplications and considering the quality of literature, the study suggests that the risk of seizures associated with DBS placement is likely lower than 2.4% (95% CI 1.7 to 3.3%). The risk of post-procedural seizures associated with chronic DBS stimulation is even lower, with estimates around 0.5% (95% CI 0.02 to 1.0%).

The paper concludes that DBS for the specified conditions carries a relatively low risk of seizure, predominantly periprocedural, and the likelihood of developing a chronic seizure disorder is extremely low. Patients can be counseled about these risks before undergoing DBS surgery.

Key words in the study include Deep Brain Stimulation, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, essential tremor, pain, obsessive-compulsive disease, seizure, and epilepsy.

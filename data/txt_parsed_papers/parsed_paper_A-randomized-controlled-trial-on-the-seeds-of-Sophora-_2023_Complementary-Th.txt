The seeds of Sophora alopecuroides var. alopecuroides have been evaluated for their effectiveness and safety in treating acute heroin withdrawal syndrome in individuals abstaining from heroin use. In this examination, participants were divided into two groups: one received three 400 mg capsules of the plant extract, and the other received a placebo, both administered orally once a day for eight days. To measure the severity of withdrawal symptoms, the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) was used at the beginning of the study, and again on days 3 and 8. Additionally, the impact of the treatment on hepatic and renal functions and complete blood count was assessed at the start and end of the study.

Results indicated a significant reduction in COWS scores in both groups after eight days, with a notably larger decrease in the group receiving the plant extract. No significant effects were observed on other measured parameters, and no side effects were reported. This suggests that the plant extract is effective in significantly alleviating symptoms of acute heroin withdrawal safely.

The trial was rigorously designed, adhering to randomized, placebo-controlled, and triple-blind methodologies, conducted in a residential addiction treatment center. The study's ethical protocols were carefully followed, with approval from relevant committees and registration in an official clinical trials registry.

At the conclusion of the study, the plant extract was found to potentially offer a safe alternative for relieving moderate to severe acute heroin withdrawal symptoms, indicating a promising avenue for further research into its efficacy and the mechanisms behind its effects. Additional investigations are recommended to compare the plant extract's effectiveness with standard treatments and to explore its potential for long-term maintenance therapy in opioid addiction.

Ablative brain surgery was employed as early as 1912 to treat Parkinson's disease. However, with the introduction of levodopa in the 1960s, the popularity of surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease declined significantly. Despite this, the limitations of levodopa therapy soon became evident as Parkinson's disease continued to progress and patients experienced complications such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. This led to a resurgence in interest in neurosurgical interventions, notably ablative procedures like pallidotomy. However, as pallidotomy became more common, its limitations also became apparent, including adverse effects like speech impairment, balance and gait problems, visual field defects, and cognitive deficits. This prompted the search for safer and more effective surgical treatments, leading to the development of deep brain stimulation.

Deep brain stimulation, which uses electrical stimuli to create a functional lesion in a specific brain area, targets two main areas for Parkinson's disease treatment: the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus. The initial reports of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease management emerged in the mid-1990s, with subsequent studies showing significant improvements in motor functioning and quality of life for patients. However, serious adverse events, including infections, depression, mood changes, psychosis, and equipment issues like lead fractures and dislodgements, were also reported. Studies on globus pallidus internus stimulation reported improved motor function and reduced symptoms, as well as an enhanced perceived quality of life. Nevertheless, complications such as hematomas, infections, and equipment issues were noted.

The need for systematic tracking, recording, and comparison of adverse outcomes according to the stimulation target has been underscored by the occurrence of serious complications. Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease has gained widespread acceptance, confirmed by an analysis of practice patterns showing it as the preferred surgical treatment. However, significant questions remain, including which stimulation target site leads to better outcomes and whether certain patients or symptoms respond better to one target over another.

A systematic review of completed work has been conducted to quantify what has been learned about the outcomes of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, synthesizing the results of published research on patient outcomes following bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus targets in the brain. This review includes a detailed analysis of the literature, focusing on motor function improvements and other outcomes following deep brain stimulation, and highlighting the need for uniform reporting of outcomes and a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of stimulating different targets.

Ablative brain surgery has been employed since 1912 to manage Parkinson's disease. The introduction of levodopa in the 1960s saw a decline in surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease. However, it soon became clear that despite levodopa treatment, Parkinson's disease continued to progress, and patients experienced treatment-related complications such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. This led to a resurgence in neurosurgical interventions, including ablative procedures like pallidotomy. Despite the initial success of pallidotomy, it was found to have significant shortcomings, including speech impairment, balance and gait problems, visual field defects, and cognitive deficits. This prompted the search for safer and more effective surgical options, especially for managing bilateral symptoms, leading to the development of deep brain stimulation.

Deep brain stimulation involves delivering electrical stimuli to create a functional lesion within a specific area of the brain. Two primary targets for deep brain stimulation in treating Parkinson's disease have been the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus. The initial reports of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease management emerged in the mid-1990s, showing significant improvements in motor functioning and quality of life following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. However, serious adverse events were also reported, including infections, depression, mood changes, psychosis requiring intervention, and equipment issues like lead fractures and dislodgements. Studies on globus pallidus internus stimulation also reported improved motor function and quality of life, but serious complications such as hematomas, infections, and equipment issues were noted. Despite these complications, deep brain stimulation has gained widespread acceptance as the preferred surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease, though significant questions remain regarding the optimal stimulation target for achieving the best outcomes.

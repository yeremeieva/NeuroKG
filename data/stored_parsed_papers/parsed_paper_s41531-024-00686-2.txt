A multi-site study was conducted to explore sex differences in cortical thickness in non-demented Parkinson's disease. The sample included 211 patients with Parkinson's disease (64.45% males; average age 65.58 years; average disease duration 6.42 years) and 86 healthy controls (50% males; average age 65.49 years) with T1-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging data from four international research centers. Generalized linear models were used to analyze sex differences in regional mean cortical thickness estimations. The relationship between cortical thickness in regions showing sex differences with age, disease duration, and age of onset was examined through multiple linear regression.

The study found that male patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated thinner cortex than female patients in six frontal regions (bilateral caudal middle frontal, bilateral superior frontal, left precentral, and right pars orbitalis), three parietal regions (bilateral inferior parietal and left supramarginal), and one limbic region (right posterior cingulate). In male patients, lower cortical thickness values in nine out of ten regions were associated with longer disease duration and older age. In contrast, in female patients, lower cortical thickness was associated with older age but with longer disease duration only in one region. Overall, male patients exhibited a more widespread pattern of reduced cortical thickness compared with female patients. Disease duration seems more relevant to explaining reduced cortical thickness in male patients, suggesting a worse prognosis over time.

The study highlights the importance of considering sex differences in neurodegenerative diseases for the development of tailored prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. It also emphasizes the need for further studies to explore sex-specific cortical atrophy trajectories using large longitudinal multi-site data.

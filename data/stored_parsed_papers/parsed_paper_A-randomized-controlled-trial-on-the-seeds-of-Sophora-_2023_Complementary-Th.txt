A randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness and safety of the seeds of Sophora alopecuroides var. alopecuroides in treating acute heroin withdrawal syndrome in individuals who had stopped using heroin. Participants were divided into two groups, with one group receiving three 400 mg capsules of the plant extract (50 participants) and the other receiving a placebo (50 participants) orally once a day for eight days. The severity of withdrawal was measured using the clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) at the start of the study and on days 3 and 8, with hepatic and renal functions and complete blood count being secondary outcomes.

Results showed a significant reduction in COWS scores in both groups after eight days, with a more significant decrease in the group receiving the plant extract. No significant effects on other health parameters were observed, and no side effects were reported. This suggests that the plant extract can safely alleviate symptoms of acute heroin withdrawal.

The trial was conducted in a residential addiction treatment center and followed strict ethical guidelines. It was also registered in the Iranian Registry for Clinical Trials. 

The main alkaloids identified in the extract were sophocarpine, matrine, and sophoramine. The study's findings are consistent with previous research on the extract's efficacy in reducing opium withdrawal symptoms in mice. However, the study did not compare the extract's effects with standard treatments for opioid withdrawal, nor did it examine the extract's impact on patients' electrocardiogram and vital signs like blood pressure. Future research should address these limitations and further investigate the compounds and mechanisms responsible for the extract's opioid withdrawal-reducing effects, as well as its efficacy and safety for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.

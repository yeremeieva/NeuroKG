Deep brain stimulation offers a non-ablative alternative to thalamotomy for the surgical treatment of medically refractory tremor in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Despite its potential, relatively few outcome reports are available.

The objective of this review is to systematically examine existing reports of deep brain stimulation usage in multiple sclerosis and to introduce four additional cases. This involves both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of existing literature and a case series from one center.

The review of available data revealed that in most cases (n = 75), the ventrointeromedial nucleus of the thalamus was the surgical target for deep brain stimulation implantation. The majority of patients achieved tremor reduction and improvements in daily functioning, with 87.7% experiencing at least some sustained improvement in tremor control post-surgery. When it comes to daily functioning, improvements were reported in 76.0% of cases where such data were available. The adverse effects were similar to those observed in deep brain stimulation treatments for other conditions.

However, the studies reviewed largely utilized non-standardized quantitative outcome measures and had follow-up periods of a year or less. Despite these limitations, the evidence suggests that chronic deep brain stimulation often results in improved tremor control in multiple sclerosis patients. It is important to note that complete tremor cessation is not always achieved, tremor control may decrease over time, and frequent reprogramming of the device may be necessary.

Multiple sclerosis is known to cause tremors in the arms, legs, trunk, and head, with the upper extremities being most commonly affected. The action tremor of multiple sclerosis may have postural or kinetic components and may affect either the proximal or distal forearm. The tremor is believed to be associated with dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. Medical treatment of this tremor is often unsatisfactory, and while ablative thalamotomy can be effective for some patients, it may not provide sustained benefits. As an alternative, chronic deep brain stimulation through implanted electrodes has been used, drawing from its success in treating Parkinsonâ€™s disease and essential tremor.

This paper also presents a case series of individuals who underwent bilateral implantation at one medical center, showing significant improvement in tremor control post-surgery. However, maintaining optimal tremor control required frequent reprogramming of the device, and in some cases, tremor control declined over time, although patients still remained above their pre-surgical baseline.

In conclusion, while chronic deep brain stimulation often leads to improved tremor control in multiple sclerosis, complete tremor cessation is not guaranteed, tremor control may decrease over time, and device reprogramming is often necessary. Further studies employing standardized quantitative outcome measures and longer follow-up periods are needed to fully assess the benefits and limitations of this treatment.

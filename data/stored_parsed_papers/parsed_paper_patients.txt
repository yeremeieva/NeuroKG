This study focuses on understanding the experiences of patients who have undergone deep brain stimulation to treat advanced Parkinson's disease, through a qualitative systematic review and synthesis of seven original research papers. These studies were carried out in Denmark, France, and Sweden, involving 116 patients who had received deep brain stimulation and nine spouses of these patients.

Before undergoing surgery, patients with advancing Parkinson's disease face significant losses and a feeling of losing control over their lives. There is a strong hope associated with what deep brain stimulation can offer them. After the surgery, many patients describe a period of euphoria, though this feeling does not last, leading to a need for significant adjustments afterwards.

A central theme identified in the experiences of deep brain stimulation is the concept of normality, suggesting that regaining a sense of control may be crucial for achieving a sense of normality. The experiences of both patients and their spouses, as well as the adjustments they need to make, are influenced by their expectations of what the surgery will enable them to achieve or regain, essentially, a new sense of normality.

The findings highlight the importance of further qualitative research to better understand these adjustments and to inform how patients and their spouses can be best supported by healthcare professionals before, during, and after deep brain stimulation. When evaluating the outcomes of deep brain stimulation and other treatments for advanced Parkinson's disease, it is essential to consider how to capture holistic concepts such as normality and control, and to ensure that studies examining the outcomes of deep brain stimulation include longer-term follow-up.

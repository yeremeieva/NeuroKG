The serotonin hypothesis of depression remains influential. This comprehensive umbrella review aimed to synthesize and evaluate the evidence regarding the association of depression with decreased serotonin concentration or activity. Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched up until December 2020 for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large data-set analyses in specific research areas related to serotonin. These areas included serotonin and its metabolite concentrations in body fluids, serotonin receptor binding, serotonin transporter levels measured through imaging or post-mortem, tryptophan depletion studies, serotonin transporter gene associations, and serotonin transporter gene-environment interactions. Studies focusing on depression linked with physical conditions or specific subtypes of depression were excluded. The quality of included studies was assessed using various tools, and the certainty of study results was evaluated with a modified grading system. The review included a total of 17 studies, comprising a mix of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other research formats.

The findings from these studies revealed variable quality, with some genetic studies being of high quality. Two meta-analyses examining the serotonin metabolite showed no association with depression. One meta-analysis found no relationship between plasma serotonin and depression but suggested that antidepressant use might be associated with lowered serotonin concentration. Other analyses provided weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced receptor or transporter binding in some brain areas, which could imply increased synaptic availability of serotonin in individuals with depression. However, the influence of prior antidepressant use could not be reliably excluded. Tryptophan depletion studies generally found no effect on mood in most healthy volunteers but indicated a possible effect in those with a family history of depression. The largest and highest quality studies on the serotonin transporter gene found no evidence of an association with depression or of an interaction between genotype and stress in relation to depression.

Overall, the main areas of serotonin research did not consistently support an association between serotonin and depression. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that depression is caused by reduced serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence suggested that long-term antidepressant use might decrease serotonin concentration.

Several studies have been conducted in vitro and in animals, showing that propolis, a resin made by bees, possesses excellent anti-inflammatory properties. However, no study has been conducted on patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of propolis supplementation on inflammatory markers in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. This longitudinal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved patients randomized into two groups: propolis or placebo for two months. The propolis group received capsules containing concentrated and standardized dry green propolis extract, while the placebo group received capsules containing microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, and colloidal silicon dioxide. Inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by flow luminometry. The study found that propolis supplementation significantly reduced the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and had a tendency to reduce the levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta. There were no significant differences in the placebo group. Thus, short-term supplementation with dry green propolis extract appears to mitigate inflammation by reducing the plasma levels of these markers in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.

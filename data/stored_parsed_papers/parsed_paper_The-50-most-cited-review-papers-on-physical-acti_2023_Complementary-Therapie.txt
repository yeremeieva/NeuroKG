The link between physical activity and depression prevention is increasingly recognized, with research rapidly expanding in this area. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the fifty most-cited review papers on physical activity and depression to identify significant research topics and suggest future research directions.

The fifty most-cited review articles were selected from the Web of Science Core Collection database, and a bibliometric citation analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer software. The analysis included data on the country and authors of publications, publishing journals, citations, keywords, and other relevant information. 

The results showed that these review articles received an average of 247.5 citations per article, with most articles originating from England, followed by other Western countries like Australia and the United States. Journals such as the Journal of Affective Disorders and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were highlighted as leading publishers in this research area. Key research topics identified included various types of physical activity and their impact on depression, intervention studies, fitness and physical activity levels in individuals with depression, methodological analyses of studies, and the effects of physical activity on depression across different populations.

In conclusion, the analysis underscores the potential for further development in the understanding of physical activity's role in preventing and managing depression. It also points out future research directions that could contribute to advancing the knowledge base in this field.

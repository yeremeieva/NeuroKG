Depressive and anxiety disorders rank among the highest causes of health-related quality of life burdens globally. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has been established as the leading treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. However, the presence of additional complex mental health disorders can reduce the effectiveness of traditional treatments targeting a single disorder. This creates a demand for transdiagnostic interventions, which apply consistent treatment principles across various mental disorders without customizing the protocol for each specific diagnosis. One such psychotherapy, known for delivering promising treatment effects similar to those of single disorder protocols across multiple mental disorders, has been evaluated for its impact on personal recovery in anxiety and depression, comparing group versus individual therapy formats.

A retrospective study assessed the outcomes of outpatients who underwent 12-week therapy in either a group or individual setting at a specialized psychiatric hospital. The analysis focused on changes in anxiety, depression, and recovery scores before and after treatment. The findings showed that both group and individual therapy participants experienced improvements in anxiety, depression, and recovery scores. Notably, a greater proportion of participants in group therapy showed improvements in interpersonal-focused domains of personal recovery, suggesting that group therapy might be particularly effective in enhancing aspects of personal recovery related to interpersonal relationships.

The study discusses the therapeutic benefits of group psychotherapy, including the development of social skills, interpersonal learning, and group cohesion, which align with personal recovery principles. Additionally, group psychotherapy increases the availability of treatment resources by allowing a single practitioner to treat multiple individuals simultaneously, making it a cost-effective method of delivering therapy. This approach aligns well with stepped care models in mental health care, which aim to improve access to evidence-based treatments and align with recovery principles.

The results indicate that group therapy is as effective as individual therapy in improving clinical outcomes for depression and anxiety and may offer additional benefits in promoting personal recovery outcomes. This highlights the potential of group therapy as a valuable treatment option for individuals with anxiety and depression, supporting the broader application of transdiagnostic treatments in mental health care. Further research is needed to explore the efficacy of these interventions in other populations and settings, including virtual delivery formats. Despite the study's limitations, such as a relatively small sample size and the inability to track long-term outcomes, it provides important insights into the clinical promise of transdiagnostic treatments for individuals with comorbid or complex mental health disorders.

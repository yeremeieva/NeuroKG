With the increasing investigation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a potential therapy for psychiatric disorders, understanding the incidence and impact of side effects plays a critical role in its ethical evaluation. This examination focuses on the discussion around side effects related to stimulating the subthalamic nucleus, a standard treatment for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, based on a comprehensive analysis of case reports, review papers, and outcome studies from a span of over a decade. The deep brain stimulation community has progressively recognized the complexity of side effects associated with the stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, reflecting the maturation of the therapy. This analysis further delves into the quality of studies and the methodologies employed to assess side effects, noting that some side effects are subject to conflicting evaluations by different stakeholders involved, complicating the ethical discussions surrounding novel treatments for diseases with psychiatric aspects. The insights gained from this examination could guide future applications of deep brain stimulation in the field of psychiatry, emphasizing the importance of considering various perspectives in the evaluation of side effects to ensure ethical practice in the advancement of medical treatments.

The relationship between combinations of physical activity, screen time, and sleep, and their association with subjective wellbeing in children was explored in a study conducted in Anhui Province, China. The study included a total of 1,098 participants, with an average age of 11.6 years. Both physical activity, screen time, sleep, and subjective wellbeing were measured using validated self-reported questionnaires. The study found that adherence to the 24-hour movement guidelines, which include recommendations for physical activity, limited screen time, and adequate sleep, was associated with better subjective wellbeing. Specifically, compliance with all three guidelines was linked to greater subjective wellbeing compared to not meeting any of the guidelines. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was observed between the number of guidelines met and improved subjective wellbeing. The study concludes that adherence to 24-hour movement guidelines is positively associated with subjective wellbeing in children.

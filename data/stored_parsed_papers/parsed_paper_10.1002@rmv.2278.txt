The impact of Parkinson's disease on manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis

Parkinson's disease patients who contracted COVID-19 experienced a decline in motor functions; however, the evidence is limited on whether Parkinson's disease patients have a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 or have worse outcomes. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the impact of Parkinson's disease on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. A systematic search was conducted through seven electronic databases under the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The R software version 4.0.2 was used to calculate pooled sample sizes and their associated confidence intervals. In total, 13 papers were included in this study. The pooled prevalence rate of COVID-19 was 2.12%. Fever, cough, fatigue, and anorexia were the most common symptoms with rates of 72.72%, 66.99%, 61.58%, and 52.55%, respectively. The pooled rates for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality were 39.89%, 4.7%, and 25.1%, respectively. Upon further comparison of hospitalization and mortality rates among COVID-19 patients with and without Parkinson's disease, there were no significant differences. In conclusion, the prevalence and prognosis of COVID-19 patients seem comparable in patients with Parkinson's disease and those without it. The increased hospitalization and mortality may be attributed to old age and co-morbidities.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the beta coronaviruses, which has a well-documented propensity for neuro-invasion. Various studies have found evidence of beta coronaviruses in the brain of patients, suggesting a potential route for these viruses to impact the central nervous system. COVID-19 neurological manifestations have been evident in many patients since the beginning of the pandemic. The COVID-19-related case fatality is higher among vulnerable groups such as older age groups and those with co-morbidities. Individuals with Parkinson's disease show multiple patterns of vulnerability, being advanced in age, mostly have age-related chronic conditions, and related polypharmacy burden. The current literature shows that Parkinson's disease patients who contracted COVID-19 had a decline in motor functions and stress-induced psychiatric problems; however, whether Parkinson's disease patients have a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 or have worse outcomes is still debatable. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to review the impact of Parkinson's disease on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

The systematic search led to the inclusion of 13 papers, analyzing data from patients with Parkinson's disease who contracted COVID-19. The analysis found that the prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with Parkinson's disease was 2.12%. Common symptoms among these patients included fever, cough, fatigue, and anorexia. Rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality were found to be significant but showed no significant difference when compared to COVID-19 patients without Parkinson's disease. This suggests that the presence of Parkinson's disease does not significantly alter the prognosis of COVID-19. The study concludes that the increased rates of hospitalization and mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease may be attributed to factors such as old age and the presence of co-morbidities rather than Parkinson's disease itself.

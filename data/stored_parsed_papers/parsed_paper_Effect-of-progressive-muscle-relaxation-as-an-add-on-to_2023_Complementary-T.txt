Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to experience a range of physical and psychological symptoms even after being discharged from the hospital. This study explored the impact of adding progressive muscle relaxation to pulmonary telerehabilitation on the physical and psychological well-being of these patients. The research was a randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group trial involving discharged COVID-19 patients between 18 and 65 years old. Participants were divided into two groups, with one receiving both pulmonary telerehabilitation and progressive muscle relaxation, and the other receiving only pulmonary telerehabilitation. They were evaluated at the start and after six weeks for primary (functional capacity) and secondary outcomes (dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life).

The group undergoing both treatments showed significant improvements in sleep quality and showed reductions in fatigue and anxiety compared to the group that only received pulmonary telerehabilitation. However, no significant differences were noted for other outcomes between the two groups. The study concluded that combining pulmonary telerehabilitation with progressive muscle relaxation was more effective in enhancing sleep quality and reducing anxiety and fatigue among discharged COVID-19 patients than pulmonary telerehabilitation alone.

The study was conducted in hospitals associated with the Qom University of Medical Sciences, from May to October 2021. Participants were recruited by screening hospital databases and were assigned to groups through a randomised process. Both groups received instructions for exercises in a face-to-face session and were advised to perform them at home for six weeks, with supervision provided via video call. The comparison group practiced breathing and strength training exercises, while the experimental group additionally performed progressive muscle relaxation exercises.

Outcomes were assessed using various tools such as the 6-minute walk test for functional capacity, the Borg scale for dyspnoea, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey for quality of life, and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for health status. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Iran University of Medical Sciences and registered in the International Database of Clinical Trials. Participants were informed about the study and consented to participate.

Brain texture changes have been studied as indicators of various clinical profiles in individuals with recent-onset psychosis and depression. The relationship between the arrangement of brain voxels and their features reveals significant information across different spatial dimensions. However, there's a gap in validating these models for individual predictions and understanding the variability in clinical profiles. Current prevention and treatment strategies are often diagnosis-specific and may not fully address the diverse outcomes and heterogeneity among patients. This study aimed to explore the cross-sectional utility of brain texture changes for identifying psychopathological states (recent-onset psychosis and recent-onset depression) and to examine how individualized brain texture maps relate to clinical symptom severity and outcome profiles.

Using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from a study, models were developed for 116 patients with recent-onset depression, 122 patients with recent-onset psychosis, and 197 healthy controls. By employing explainable artificial intelligence and clustering analysis, the study investigated the contrast texture feature of the brain as a key identifier of general psychopathological states. The prediction model showed discrimination power greater than 72% and was validated in a second independent sample of participants. Clustering analysis helped map the brain texture changes, revealing eight distinct clusters. These clusters were then analyzed for their association with clinical symptom severity and outcome profiles, revealing unique patterns of brain alterations linked with specific clinical outcomes, such as symptom severity and functionality.

The study indicates that brain texture changes, as captured through advanced imaging and analysis techniques, can offer valuable insights into the psychopathological states of individuals with recent-onset psychosis and depression. The ability to identify unique patterns associated with clinical profiles suggests potential for developing more personalized and effective treatment strategies.

The effectiveness and safety of Jihwang-eumja compared to Western medications in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Background and purpose: Jihwang-eumja has been shown to be effective in reducing Î²-amyloid expression and activating monoamine oxidase and acetylcholinesterase in rat models. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Jihwang-eumja in Alzheimer's disease compared to Western medications.

Methods: Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, CNKI, ScienceON, KISS, and Kmbase. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of Jihwang-eumja and Western medications on cognition and the activities of daily living in Alzheimer's disease were included. The results were synthesized using meta-analysis. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and the evidence level of each outcome was suggested using the GRADE system.

Results: A total of 165 studies were screened, and six were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 245 and 240 participants were included in the intervention and comparison groups, respectively. The results showed that Mini-Mental State Examination was 3.19 higher, and the standardized mean difference of activities of daily living was 1.13 higher in the Jihwang-eumja group than in the Western medications group. The included studies contained some concerns of the risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence was considered moderate.

Conclusion: Despite the small number of studies and high heterogeneity, Jihwang-eumja was found to be applicable for Alzheimer's disease.

Introduction: Dementia is a complex neurocognitive syndrome characterized by severe impairment in memory, orientation, understanding, calculation, learning, language, and judgment. Over 55 million people have dementia worldwide, with estimates projecting a rise to 78 million by 2030. The most common subtype of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, characterized by progressive loss of synapses and neurons, accumulation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and prominent cholinergic deficits. Currently, pharmacological treatment is only symptomatic and unsatisfactory for permanently stabilizing the disease. In traditional Korean medicine, various herbal medications have been studied for Alzheimer's disease. Jihwang-eumja, initially found in ancient medical texts, is considered for treating conditions related to kidney insufficiency, which is linked to the pathogenesis of dementia in Korean traditional medicine.

Methods: This study's protocol was registered, and searches were conducted without language restriction or date limits in several databases. The eligibility criteria were organized by the PICOS format, and only randomized controlled trials were included. The quality of the included trials was evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and data synthesis and analysis were performed using appropriate statistical methods. The evidence level across the included studies was assessed using the GRADE tool for clinical recommendations.

Results: Six studies were included, all published in China. The interventions varied in terms of formula, ingredients, and dose of Jihwang-eumja. The comparison groups were treated with Western medications. To evaluate cognitive function, Mini-Mental State Examination and other cognitive assessments were used. Activities of daily living were assessed using the ADL scale. Safety evaluations included adverse events reporting and laboratory tests. The meta-analysis showed that Jihwang-eumja was more effective in improving cognitive function and activities of daily living than Western medications. The relative risk of adverse events was lower in the Jihwang-eumja group compared to the Western medications group.

Conclusion: Jihwang-eumja showed potential applicability for Alzheimer's disease, with a moderate certainty of evidence. Further research with larger sample sizes and standardized interventions is needed to confirm these findings.

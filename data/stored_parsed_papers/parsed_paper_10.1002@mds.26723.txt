New Methods for the Assessment of Parkinson's Disease from 2005 to 2015: A Systematic Review

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the development of novel methods aimed at enhancing the assessment of Parkinson's disease through technology in laboratory, clinical, and home settings. This review systematically evaluates these new assessment methods for Parkinson's disease regarding their maturity, feasibility, and usefulness in assessing the main features of the disease.

Methods: This review analyzed articles published between 2005 and 2015, focusing on technology-based assessment methods for Parkinson's disease. A total of 9,503 publications were identified, 848 full papers were evaluated, and 588 original articles were assessed for technological, demographic, clinimetric, and technology transfer readiness parameters.

Results: The majority of the studies included fewer than 30 patients, less than half used a standard methodology to validate diagnostic tests, and a small percentage confirmed their results in a different dataset. Most studies were conducted in a clinic or laboratory setting. The axial features domain was the most commonly studied, followed by bradykinesia, while rigidity and non-motor domains were rarely investigated. Only a small fraction of the systems reached a technology level that could potentially be included in clinical assessments in the near future.

Conclusions: This systematic evaluation provides an overview of the current options for quantitative assessment of Parkinson's disease and future expectations. There is a need for standardized and collaborative studies to confirm preliminary findings, assess under-investigated domains, and better validate existing and upcoming technology-based assessment methods for Parkinson's disease.

The past decade has seen an exponential growth in the development of new methods to enhance the assessment of Parkinson's disease using various technologies. These include wearable sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, smartphones, and other electronic systems to collect physiological signals related to both motor and non-motor aspects of the disease. Despite some technologies not being new, their application in the field of Parkinson's disease assessment has grown significantly, aiming to provide objective measures of the disease's aspects.

This review offers a comprehensive evaluation of technology-based assessment methods for Parkinson's disease investigated in the past ten years. It covers both wearable and non-wearable technologies, assesses approaches for the most relevant disease domains and complications, and employs a systematic approach that includes a wide range of keywords and terms. The review also presents clinimetric information and, for the first time, the technology readiness level of every system reported in the evaluated studies.

After reading this article, clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders will have a clear understanding of how quantitative assessments of Parkinson's disease have evolved recently, what the current options are, and what can be expected in the near future from these technologies. The review also includes a publicly shared systematic spreadsheet that contains detailed information on the evaluated systems, serving as a resource for further analysis and updates on the development of new assessment methods for Parkinson's disease.

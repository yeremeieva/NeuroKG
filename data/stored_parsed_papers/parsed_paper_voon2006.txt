Deep Brain Stimulation: Neuropsychological and Neuropsychiatric Issues

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that not only affects motor skills but also causes cognitive, neuropsychiatric, autonomic, and other nonmotor symptoms. Deep brain stimulation has been recognized as effective for managing the motor symptoms in advanced stages of the disease. However, its impact on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms is less clear and has become a significant area of clinical and pathophysiological interest. This review focuses on the cognitive and neuropsychiatric effects of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, highlighting that most neuropsychiatric symptoms observed are transient, treatable, and potentially preventable.

A variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease range from cognitive disorders and mood changes to anxiety, hallucinations, and apathy. Additionally, behaviors such as excessive use of dopaminergic medications for nonmotor purposes, hypersexuality, and pathological gambling have been identified due to dopaminergic medication administration. Although deep brain stimulation for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease has proven efficacy, its effects on nonmotor cognitive and psychiatric symptoms require further clarity.

The majority of literature suggests that deep brain stimulation, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus, results in minimal cognitive morbidity in well-selected patients. However, declines in word fluency, verbal memory, and certain executive functions have been reported in some studies. Factors such as age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, and changes in dopaminergic medications post-surgery have been considered as potential risk factors for cognitive and neuropsychiatric changes following deep brain stimulation. Moreover, the impact of stimulation on cognitive performance has shown improvements in some cognitive domains but declines in others, highlighting the complex relationship between stimulation, medication status, and cognitive outcomes.

Regarding neuropsychiatric outcomes, transient confusion, hypomania, emotional reactivity, depression, and even suicides have been reported in patients following deep brain stimulation, with variations in the reported frequencies of these symptoms. The literature suggests that, although group depression scores may improve over time, the clinical relevance of these findings and the actual risk of developing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms post-surgery remain areas requiring further investigation. 

In conclusion, while deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease has demonstrated efficacy and safety in the majority of well-selected patients, careful preoperative and postoperative management of cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects is crucial. Further studies with control groups and standardized diagnostic criteria are needed to better understand the pathophysiology and manage the cognitive and psychiatric complications associated with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.

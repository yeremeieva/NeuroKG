Clinical decision support for managing depressive episodes in individuals with bipolar disorder continues to be a challenging task for clinicians, despite the presence of treatment guidelines. In other areas, large language models have shown promise in aiding clinical decision-making. To explore this potential, a study was conducted using 50 clinical vignettes representing cases of bipolar depression. These vignettes were evaluated by experts in the field, who identified optimal and poor pharmacotherapy choices. The same vignettes were then assessed by a large language model, both with and without augmentation by recent bipolar treatment guidelines, to identify the best pharmacotherapy options. The performance of the augmented model was compared to expert recommendations and a sample of community clinicians.

The augmented model, when prompted with treatment guidelines, correctly identified the expert-preferred pharmacotherapy in more than half of the cases. This performance was significantly better than that of an un-augmented model and was more in line with expert recommendations than the average community clinician's choices. The augmented model's ability to prioritize expert-endorsed options highlights its potential as a scalable and promising strategy for clinical decision support. However, the study also noted the importance of further research to ensure such models do not lead to overreliance by clinicians or propagate bias.

In addition to comparing model outputs, the study also assessed potential biases by examining the impact of changing the gender or race of the vignette characters. The results did not show meaningful differences, suggesting that the model's performance was consistent across different demographic groups.

This investigation into the use of large language models for clinical decision support in bipolar depression suggests that augmenting these models with evidence-based guidelines can improve their utility. Future studies focusing on the efficacy of these models in clinical practice, as well as strategies to mitigate any potential for bias or clinician overreliance, are necessary.

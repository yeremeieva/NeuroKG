Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that involves the implantation of electrodes in specific areas of the brain to deliver electrical pulses. This technique, which can be adjusted and reversed, does not destroy brain tissue and is being explored as a treatment for various psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and depressive disorder. Recent studies in animals and humans suggest DBS could be an effective treatment for addiction, particularly for cases resistant to other treatments. However, the optimal brain targets for DBS in addiction treatment are not fully determined. This review aims to provide a systematic overview of the existing research on DBS for addiction, focusing on potential brain targets based on the efficacy and safety data from preclinical and clinical studies.

Seven animal studies targeting six different brain areas - the nucleus accumbens, subthalamic nucleus, dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus - and eleven human studies focusing on the nucleus accumbens and subthalamic nucleus were analyzed. The nucleus accumbens emerges as the most promising target for DBS in addiction treatment, with the medial prefrontal cortex also showing potential but requiring further research to confirm its effectiveness.

The review also discusses the neurocircuitry underlying addiction, highlighting the roles of different brain regions in the addiction cycle, including the binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (craving) stages. The effectiveness of DBS may involve its interaction with these neuroanatomical circuits.

In animal studies, DBS of the nucleus accumbens, subthalamic nucleus, lateral habenula, and medial prefrontal cortex showed effectiveness in reducing drug-seeking behavior or consumption with minimal side effects. These findings suggest that DBS can modulate addiction-related behaviors without significantly impacting natural motivators like food or water intake. Clinical studies have also explored the effects of DBS on addiction, with varying degrees of success and some side effects.

In conclusion, DBS presents a promising intervention for treatment-resistant addiction, with the nucleus accumbens being the most promising target. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential of DBS in addiction treatment, including translational issues, medical ethical considerations, and the design of clinical trials.

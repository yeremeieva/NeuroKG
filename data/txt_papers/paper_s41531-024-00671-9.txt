Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder in ﬂuenced by several environmental and
genetic factors. Effective disease-modifying therapies and robust early-stage biomarkers are stilllacking, and an improved understanding of the molecular changes in PD could help to reveal newdiagnostic markers and pharmaceutical targets. Here, we report results from a cohort-wide bloodplasma metabolic pro ﬁling of PD patients and controls in the Luxembourg Parkinson ’s Study to detect
disease-associated alterations at the level of systemic cellular process and network alterations. Weidenti ﬁed statistically signi ﬁcant changes in both individual metabolite levels and global pathway
activities in PD vs. controls and signi ﬁcant correlations with motor impairment scores. As a primary
observation when investigating shared molecular sub-network alterations, we detect pronounced andcoordinated increased metabolite abundances in xanthine metabolism in de novo patients, which areconsistent with previous PD case/control transcriptomics data from an independent cohort in terms ofknown enzyme-metabolite network relationships. From the integrated metabolomics andtranscriptomics network analysis, the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) isdetermined as a potential key regulator controlling the shared changes in xanthine metabolism andlinking them to a mechanism that may contribute to pathological loss of cellular adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) in PD. Overall, the investigations revealed signi ﬁcant PD-associated metabolome
alterations, including pronounced changes in xanthine metabolism that are mechanistically congruentwith alterations observed in independent transcriptomics data. The enzyme HPRT1 may merit furtherinvestigation as a main regulator of these network alterations and as a potential therapeutic target toaddress downstream molecular pathology in PD.
The diagnosis of Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is typically based on clinical
symptoms, such as tremors, rigidity, a nd bradykinesia, following standard
guidelines for previously validated clinical assessments. While clinicaldiagnosis has improved continuously over the past decades and includes
indicators for differential and early diagnosis, many of the covered symp-toms are nonspeci ﬁc. These may overlap with other neurological disorders

diagnosis or delayed diagnosis1. One of the main challenges in the clinical
diagnosis is a long pre-motor phase of the disease, during which many
common symptoms may not yet be present or may be subclinical. Differ-
entiating PD from other neurological disorders, such as atypical or sec-
ondary parkinsonism, during this pre-motor phase can be challenging2.I n
addition, PD phenotypes can vary subs tantially, highlighting a need for
objective biological biomarker signatures rather than diagnosis based solelyon a subjective judgment.
Molecular signatures have the potential to provide more speci ﬁc,
accurate, and cost-effective indicators of a complex disorder such as PD.While clinical indicators mostly rely on assessing broad categories ofsymptomatic and disease-associated changes, molecular markers mayreveal more granular pathological changes occurring already in the pre-symptomatic disease stages. By facilitating an earlier, more reliable, and
speciﬁc diagnosis, molecular signatures m ay enable more patient-tailored
and effective treatments.
In recent years, omics technologies have signi ﬁcantly contributed to
discovering PD biomarkers. Numero us genetic, protein, and metabolic
changes associated with PD have been identi ﬁed through these approaches,
and new insights into the disease pathogenesis were gained
3. For instance,
several genetic variants have been link ed to an increased risk of developing
PD4. Additionally, proteomic studies have revealed altered protein levels in
PD brain tissue, including an increased abundance of alpha-synuclein,which plays a central role in Lewy body and Lewy neurites formation as ahallmark pathological feature of PD
5. Finally, prior metabolomic studies in
PD have identi ﬁed changes in disease-relevant cellular pathways, particu-
larly in those related to energy metabolism6.
Despite these advances, omics-b ased biomarker discovery for PD
is still hampered by several limita tions and challenges. While high
cross-validated accuracies for PD d iagnosis have been reported for
some of the published omics signatures7,8, the training and test set
sizes used to evaluate the corresponding machine learning (ML)models are often small. In addition, the signatures for the most pre-dictive models have often been derived from tissues or body ﬂuids
with limited practical accessibility, e.g., cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF),
which requires a lumbar puncture for sample collection. A further
common limitation of the multidimensional patterns in PD mole-
cular biomarker signatures is that they can emerge as black-boxmodels that are not fully intuitive to interpret
9. Considering this and
the limited sample sizes in many prior studies, more research isneeded to ﬁnd robust and interpretable PD-speci ﬁcm o l e c u l a r
signatures.
To contribute to the ongoing research efforts in this ﬁeld, we have
conducted a cohort-wide blood plasma metabolic pro ﬁling of 549 PD
patients and 590 controls in the Luxembourg Parkinson ’sS t u d y
(LuxPARK
10) combined with subsequent statistical and bioinformatics
pathway and network analyses. As a distinctive characteristic of other stu-
dies focusing on PD patients who have already received dopaminergic
medication, we included biospecimens from all 56 untreated de novopatients available in the cohort. This subset of samples was used to distin-guish between treatment-associated an d treatment-independent metabolite
changes.
To mechanistically interpret PD-associated alterations in the context of
cellular networks and exploit prior in formation from complementary omics
data, we have mapped the metabolomics statistics onto a dedicated genome-scale enzyme-metabolite network together with transcriptomics data froman independent PD case/control study. Through the integrated analysis ofthese omics data, we identi ﬁed coordinated sub-network alterations, par-
ticularly in xanthine metabolism, which displayed regulatory consistent
changes between metabolite abunda nces and the expression of enzyme-
encoding genes. These consistent sub-network changes may help to pave theway towards more robust blood-based biomarker signatures and providenew insights into coordinated, disease-associated cellular process altera-t i o n si nP D .Results
When studying metabolite abundance changes in de novo PD patientscompared to controls and in all PD patients (including subjects who hadreceived dopaminergic treatments) vs. controls, we identi ﬁed several
metabolites with a statistically signi ﬁcant alteration (adjusted pvalue <=
0.05). Figure 1presents a volcano plot for the de novo PD vs. control
comparison, highlighting the metabolites with both high statistical sig-niﬁcance and pronounced effect sizes. Table 1shows the top 25 most sig-
niﬁcant metabolites in de novo PD vs. controls, and Table 2shows the
metabolites with shared signi ﬁcance in de novo PD vs. controls and all PD
vs. controls (complete ranking tables of all signi ﬁcant metabolites for the
individual comparisons are provided in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6;rankings for treated patients only are provided in Supplementary Table 7).The metabolites with shared signi ﬁc a n c ea l s od i s p l a yt h es a m ed i r e c t i o no f
the change, i.e., the signs of the log fol d-changes are identical. We grouped
the signi ﬁcantly altered metabolites by shared functional categories to dis-
cuss them in the context of the prior literature on molecular mechanismsin PD.
Xanthine metabolites (inosine, xanthosine, xanthine,
hypoxanthine)
Among the signi ﬁcant abundance alteratio ns, xanthine metabolites
stand out with a shared increased abundance in de novo PD vs.control for four representatives of this group: inosine, xanthosine,xanthine, and hypoxanthine (highlighted by the star symbol in theﬁrst column of Table 1). While these changes are highly signi ﬁcant in
de novo patients, they are not obser ved when comparing only treated
PD patients vs. controls after multip le hypothesis testing adjustments
(see Supplementary Table 7). Since the effect of dopaminergic med-i c a t i o no nb l o o dm e t a b o l i t el e v e l si nt h eg r o u po ft r e a t e dp a t i e n t scannot be removed entirely by the conducted ﬁltering and statistical
adjustments, a higher measurement variation in this group as com-pared to the de novo PD subgroup is in line with our expectations.However, the difference between treatment-naïve and treated

Table 3).
Interestingly, xanthine metabolites have already been implicated
in PD through multiple mechanism s. One of the proposed functionall i n k st om o l e c u l a rh a l l m a r k so fP Di st h eg e n e r a t i o no fr e a c t i v e
oxygen species by xanthine oxidase (also known as xanthine dehy-drogenase or XDH). When XDH catalyzes the conversion ofhypoxanthine to xanthine, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) O
2-and
H2O2are generated11. ROS can induce oxidative stress, which may
damage cellular components such as mitochondria and dopaminergicneurons. In PD, this can contribu te to the loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra as one of the main pathological
characteristics of the disease. Indeed, increased levels of XDH in theblood of PD patients have previously been reported
12,m a t c h i n go u r
observed metabolite changes in th is pathway. Changes in oxidative
stress signaling in PD are further evidenced by the signi ﬁcant PD-
associated decreased abundance of gamma-glutamylalanine (see
Table 2), which is involved in the metabolism of glutathione, an
antioxidant that is essential for cellular protection against oxidative
damage13.
In addition to this association with ROS generation, xanthine and
some of its derivatives, including paraxanthine, theophylline, and caffeine,have been linked to neuroprotective mechanisms in PD. In an MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model of PD, Xu etal. demonstrated that the administration of paraxanthine, theophylline,and caffeine signi ﬁcantly attenuated MPTP-induced dopamine depletion,
as reported in their study
14. For caffeine in particular, several epidemio-
logical studies have also consistently shown a signi ﬁcant negative corre-
lation between its consumption and a PD diagnosis15, although this may
be explained by inverse causation (e.g., reduced caffeine consumption due
its effects as central nervous system stimulant, potentially worsening PD
symptoms). Furthermore, the substituted xanthine molecule has beenused as a scaffold to synthesize new drug-like compounds as a non-dopaminergic strategy for neuroprotection
16. The main proposed
mechanisms for the protective actions of xanthines and caffeine in thiscontext include the antagonism of the adenosine A2A receptor(ADORA2A) and inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B).Indeed, A2A is targeted by the drug istradefylline, a xanthine derivativewith a particularly long half-life, which has been approved by the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) as an add-on treatment to levodopa (L-DOPA) for Parkinson ’s patients with motor ﬂuctuations
17. For the second
proposed xanthine target, MAO-B, pharmacological inhibitors belong to
theﬁrst drugs developed for treating PD18.
In summary, multiple different pathways have been proposed to link
alterations in xanthine metabolis m with pathological or protective
mechanisms in PD. To better understand the speci ﬁc processes involved in
xanthine abundance alterations in PD and identify the potential enzymesinvolved, we have further investigated xanthine metabolism as part of a jointnetwork analysis of the metabolomics data and independent PD case/control transcriptomics data (see section on “Integrative network analysis of
metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in PD ”).

npj Parkinson ’s Disease |           (2024) 10:68 3Catecholamine metabolism (retinal, ALDH1A1)
Besides the xanthines, the carotenoid retinal was the only other
metabolite exhibiting a signi ﬁcantly higher abundance in both de
novo PD vs. controls and all PD patie nts vs. controls. Retinal is the
oxidized form of retinol, most well-known as a constituent of visualpigments. Interestingly, the en zyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1
(ALDH1A1), responsible for converting retinal into retinoic acid, hasalready been implicated in the cat echolaldehyde hypothesis of PD
19,20.
This hypothesis proposes that long-term increased build-up ofDOPAL (3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetal dehyde), a toxic catecholalde-
hyde metabolite of dopamine which is converted by ALDH1A1 into
its non-toxic form DOPAC (3,4-Dihy droxyphenylacetic acid), plays a
pathogenic role in the development of the disease. It suggests that
DOPAL contributes to the damage to neurons in the substantia nigra
pars compacta , resulting in the typical motor symptoms associated
with PD. Consistent with the increased levels of retinal in PD, wedetected a matching PD-associated decrease in the gene expression ofALDH1A1 in the studied PD case/control transcriptomics data
(adjusted pvalue = 5.65E-04), which could result in reduced con-
version of retinal to retinoic acid.
Metabolites associated with nutrition and the microbiome (oxa-
late, tartronate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 3-CMPFP, 3-
methylcytidine)
The identi ﬁed metabolites with signi ﬁcant PD-associations include multiple
compounds previously linked to microbiome composition or diet. Amongthese compounds, oxalate is a naturally occurring substance present in large
quantities in many plants but only found in very low concentrations inanimal tissues
21. It may therefore serve as an in dicator for a predominantly
plant-based diet. It displayed a signi ﬁcantly decreased abundance in de novo
PD vs. controls (adj. pvalue = 0.021), whereas in the all-PD patients vs.
control comparison, the decrease was only close to the signi ﬁcance
threshold (adj. pvalue = 0.051). As previous st udies suggested that adher-
ence to plant-based diets, which are typically high in antioxidants and anti-inﬂammatory compounds, may be asso ciated with a reduced risk of
developing PD
22or improved motor performance23and slower disease
progression24, oxalate may warrant further stu dy as marker for a plant-based
diet and potential associated bene ﬁcial effects.
A further metabolite with known dietary associations is tar-
tronate, which displayed a signi ﬁcantly reduced abundance in both allPD patients vs. controls (adj. pvalue = 7.65E-03) and de novo PD vs.
controls (adj. pvalue = 0.049). Tartronate is a monosaccharide that
has been detected in several natural foods, including sourdough andground cherries, among others
25, and linked with the presence of
various bacterial species in the human microbiome26.W h i l ep o t e n t i a l
mechanisms linking tartronate to PD are still unknown, signi ﬁcant
decreased serological abundances in early-stage PD have already beenreported for an independent cohort for both tartronate and oxalate
27,
matching with the ﬁndings of our study.
Among the diet-associated metabolites with increased abundance,
4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HP) displayed signi ﬁcance speci ﬁco n l yt ot h e
de novo PD vs. control comparison (adj. pvalue = 0.032). 4-HP can be
found naturally in human tissues and bio ﬂuids and in several natural foods,
and it is also produced by m ultiple microbial species25. However, since 4-HP
does not provide a suf ﬁciently speci ﬁc marker for individual food items or
bacterial species, further research is needed to link the observed increase inde novo PD to speci ﬁc mechanisms.
Next, the metabolite 3-carboxy-4-me thyl-5-pentyl-2- furanpropionate
(3-CMPFP), which showed a signi ﬁcantly decreased abundance in all PD
patients compared to controls (adj. pvalue = 1.34E-04) and a nominally
signiﬁcant decrease in de novo PD vs. control ( pvalue = 9.41E-04; adj. p
value = 5.86E-02), is a furan fatty acid previously suggested as a marker forﬁsh oil intake
28, which could indicate a diet with high levels of omega-3 fatty
acids. The metabolite was also report ed to act as a protein-bound uremic
toxin and interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in cellular
damage28. Thus, the decrease of 3-CMPFP in PD may be linked to disease-
relevant processes through indirect di etary associations or direct mechan-
istic pathways.
Finally, the metabolite 3-methylcytidine (m3C), which was sig-
niﬁcantly decreased in de novo PD vs. controls (adj. pvalue = 0.016;
with a similar trend in the all PD vs. control comparison, but nostatistical signi ﬁcance, adj. pvalue = 0.18), is a pyrimidine nucleoside
previously proposed as a urinary biomarker of whole grain intake

npj Parkinson ’s Disease |           (2024) 10:68 4Metabolites involved in fatty acid metabolism and β-oxidation
(benzoylcarnitine, butyrate, 2-butenoylglycine)
Among the signi ﬁcant metabolites, we identi ﬁed multiple compounds
involved in fatty acid metabol ism, particularly in the β-oxidation pathway.
One of the most pronounced changes was observed for an acylcarnitine,
benzoylcarnitine, showing a shared decreased abundance in de novo PD vs.controls and all PD patients vs. controls (see Table 2) .A l t e r a t i o n si na c y l -
carnitine metabolism have been associ ated with a dysregulation of mito-
chondrial β-oxidation in PD
34.β-oxidation breaks down fatty acids into acetyl
CoA (coenzyme A), which can then enter the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycleto generate ATP, ful ﬁlling cellular energy needs. Acylcarnitines, such as
benzoylcarnitine, are used as carriers to transport activated long-chain fattyacids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. In PD, increased long-chain fatty
acids and decreased long-chain acylcar nitines have been observed, suggesting
an impairment of mitochondrial β-oxidation
34. Interestingly, the drug zoni-
samide, which has been used to treat resting tremor and motor ﬂuctuations in
PD, was previously shown to increase the abundance of multiple long-chainacylcarnitines associat ed with improved fatty acid β-oxidation
35.
A further metabolite a ssociated with fatty acid β-oxidation is butyrate, a
short-chain fatty acid formed by bacter ial fermentation of carbohydrates,
e.g., from dietary ﬁber, in the intestine25. Butyrate is found ubiquitously in
plant oils and animal fat and is contained in many dairy food products25.
Here, a signi ﬁcant increase in butyrate, or, respectively, its isomer iso-
butyrate, was observed in de novo PD vs. control but not when comparingtreated PD to controls. Differences in butyrate levels may result fromchanges in its production or utilization. For example, differences in diet or
medicine intake can in ﬂuence gut bacterial butyrate production, and the gut
microbiome in PD patients has been reported to have a reduced fraction ofbutyrate-producing bacteria in multiple studies
36–42. Similar to the acylcar-
nitines, butyrate is involved in fatty ac id ß-oxidation, where it serves as an
intermediate metabolite. Its increased abundance may therefore indicatedysfunctional β-oxidation in PD. However, butyrate has also been proposed
to inﬂuence PD symptoms through a variety of other mechanisms. For
instance, sodium butyrate intake was r eported to reduce PD-related motor
symptoms via mechanisms associat ed with gut microbial dysbiosis
regulation
43, intestinal barrier protection through the activation of G-
protein-coupled receptor 109 A (GPR109A)44, and stimulation of glucagon-
like peptide-145. In contrast to these proposed protective effects, a study in a
mouse model of neurodegeneration u sing the toxin MPTP reported wor-
sening effects of sodium butyrate administration on motor function, asso-ciated with upregulation of pro-in ﬂammatory cytokine expression and
increased colonic in ﬂammation
46. Overall, the potential effects of butyrate
on gut dysfunction and in ﬂammation warrant further investigation.
Finally, as a further change associated with fatty acid ß-oxidation,
2-butenoylglycine was signi ﬁcantly increased in de novo PD vs. controls.
This metabolite belongs to the class of acylglycines, which can be producedthrough glycine conjugation of acyl- CoA esters. Glycine conjugation in
mammals is often used as a detoxi ﬁcation method to promote the excretion
of carboxylic acids, and the increase of crotonylglycine may therefore re ﬂect
the response to a pathological accumulation of crotonyl-CoA. Similar tobutyrate, crotonyl-CoA is an intermedi ate in fatty acid ß-oxidation, and the
alterations in crotonylg lycine match with previously reported changes in
fatty acid β-oxidation in PD
47. Moreover, in anaerobic bacteria, crotonyl-
C o As e r v e sa sa ni n t e r m e d i a t ef o rb u t y r a t ep r o d u c t i o n48, and the shared
increase in crotonylglycine and butyrate may therefore re ﬂect the same
pathway alteration.
In summary, multiple observed metabolite abundance changes point
to PD-associated alterations in fatty acid metabolism, speci ﬁcally in fatty
acid β-oxidation, where a dominant increase of intermediate metabolites
matches previous independent reports of incomplete β-oxidation in PD34,47.
Metabolites associated with non-dopaminergic medication
While the comparison of de novo patien ts vs. controls reveals PD-related
metabolite changes that are independ ent of dopaminergic treatments, de
novo patients may still take other non-dopaminergic medications that canbe detected in the metabolomics pro ﬁle. We therefore investigated the
metabolite changes in de novo patients v s. controls for potential effects of
non-dopaminergic drugs and identi ﬁed two signi ﬁcant drug-related
metabolites: oxazepam and 4-hydroxycoumarin (see Table 1). Oxazepam
is the active ingredient in many sedatives and is used to treat anxiety and
depression, which commonly occurs in PD49.W h i l es u f ﬁciently detailed
medication data for participants i n the cohort was not available to con ﬁrm
the intake of corresponding drugs, tr eatment with sedatives is the most
plausible explanation for the signi ﬁcantly increased oxazepam abundance
observed in de novo PD. By contrast, 4-hydroxycoumarin was signi ﬁcantly
reduced in de novo PD. This compound serves as an anticoagulant forconditions caused by a blood clot
50. However, coumarins also have anti-
inﬂammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective actions51with potential
relevance for PD. In particular, coumarins can inhibit monoamine oxidase(MAO) enzymes
52, which are well-established PD drug targets (see the
section above on the actions of xanthines on MAO-B). Thus, potential
protective actions of 4-hydroxycoumarin resulting in a preferential detec-tion of this compound in contro ls may merit further study.
Altered metabolites with unknown identity
Among the top 25 most signi ﬁcant metabolites in the de novo PD vs.
controls comparison, the chemical id entity could not be resolved for one
metabolite with an increased abund ance in PD (metabolite ID: X-24494)
and two metabolites with a decreased abundance (metabolite IDs: X-15674,X-12812; the latter also showed a signi ﬁcant decrease in all PD patients vs.
controls). Possible reasons for this inc lude the lack of a reference standard
for these molecules or the chemical interference of other metabolites. As the
libraries and annotations by the meta bolomics service provider Metabolon
and the reference databases are continuously updated, we will complementthe current annotations with every signi ﬁcant update in the future and
publish relevant new ﬁndings on the GitLab repository associated with this
study (see section “Data availability ”).
Pathway enrichment analysis of metabolite changes in PD
While the analysis of individual metabolites already revealed multiple sig-
niﬁcant PD-associated changes in meta bolites with similar functions, we
performed further complementary pat hway analyses to identify and inter-
pret coordinated alterations in the data. For this purpose, we tested the over-
representation of differentially ab undant metabolites in de novo PD vs.
controls in pathways from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes andGenomes) database
53(RRID:SCR_012773) and metabolite sets representing
chemical structure classes in the software MetaboAnalyst54
(RRID:SCR_015539), using the entire s et of named metabolites as back-
ground reference (see Supplementary Table 8) and focusing on the meta-bolite sets with at least 5 metabolites.
For both databases only nominally signi ﬁcant pathways were identi-
ﬁed, including “Fatty Acids and Conjugates ”(pvalue = 1.9E-3, adj. p
value = 0.25), and “Fatty Acyls ”(pvalue = 4.96E-02, adj. pvalue = 1) for the
chemical structure classes (see Fig. 2and Supplementary Table 9), and
“Ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis ”(pvalue = 2.26E-
02, adj. pvalue = 1), “Retinol metabolism ”(pvalue = 2.26E-02, adj. p
value = 1), and “Tyrosine metabolism ”(pvalue = 4.96E-02, adj. pvalue = 1)
for the KEGG database (see Fig. 3and Supplementary Table 10).
Changes in “Fatty Acids and Conjugates ”and “Fatty Acyls ”match with
the statistically signi ﬁcant alterations in individual metabolites in fatty acid
metabolism already discussed (see section “Fatty acid metabolism /
β-oxidation ”). A suppression of mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation in an
early stage of PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage I) , characterized by decreased levels
of long-chain acylcarnitine, has been described before and proposed as apotential diagnostic biomarker for PD
34. While the mechanism behind this
dysregulation is still unclear, an overexpression of a mutant form of the gene
encoding alpha-synuclei n (A53T-SNCA) linked to familial cases of PD has
been shown to increase triacylglycerol levels and associated with increasedactivity of acyl-CoA synthetase, which catalyzes fatty acyl-CoA formation asa substrate for β-oxidation

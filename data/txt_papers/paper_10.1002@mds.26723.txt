ABSTRACT: Background: The past decade has
witnessed a highly dynamic and growing expansion ofnovel methods aimed at improving the assessment ofParkinson’s disease with technology (NAM-PD) in labo-ratory, clinical, and home environments. However, thecurrent state of NAM-PD regarding their maturity, feasi-bility, and usefulness in assessing the main PD featureshas not been systematically evaluated.
Methods: A systematic review of articles published in
the ﬁeld from 2005 to 2015 was performed. Of 9,503publications identiﬁed in PubMed and the Web of Sci-ence, 848 full papers were evaluated, and 588 originalarticles were assessed to evaluate the technological,demographic, clinimetric, and technology transfer readi-
ness parameters of NAM-PD.
Results: Of the studies, 65% included fewer than 30
patients, <50% employed a standard methodology to
validate diagnostic tests, 8% conﬁrmed their results ina different dataset, and 87% occurred in a clinic or lab.The axial features domain was the most frequently
studied, followed by bradykinesia. Rigidity and nonmo-tor domains were rarely investigated. Only 6% of thesystems reached a technology level that justiﬁed thehope of being included in clinical assessments in a use-ful time period.Conclusions: This systematic eval uation provides an
overview of the current options for quantitative assess-ment of PD and what can be expected in the near future.There is a particular need for standardized and collabora-tive studies to conﬁrm the results of preliminary initiatives,assess domains that are curren tly underinvestigated, and
better validate the exist ing and upcoming NAM-PD.

Recently there has been an exponential development
of novel methods to improve the assessment of Parkin-
son’s disease (PD) by using different technologies(NAM-PD; Supplementary Figure). Wearable sensors,
accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, smart-
phones, and a plethora of other electronic systems
have been employed to obtain physiological signals
related to motor and nonmotor aspects of the dis-
ease.
1-3Although some of the used technologies are
not new (the ﬁrst accelerometer was invented by
George Atwood in 1783), they all represent methods
that have recently been investigated and used for the------------------------------------------------------------

This systematic review presents a comprehensive
evaluation of the NAM-PD investigated in the past 10years. Our efforts should be considered in light of oth-er recent initiatives.
2,4,7-9In addition to a narrative2
and a systematic review9by some of the authors listed
here, a systematic review on wearable technology forthe assessment of gait and balance has recently beenpublished.
7None of these reviews provide an exhaus-
tive and comprehensive overview of the current stateof the NAM-PD ﬁeld and how far (potentially clinical-ly relevant) quantitative assessment strategies havebeen developed. This review combines the strengths ofall of these previous initiatives. It includes informationabout both wearable and nonwearable technologies;covers the assessment approaches of the most relevantdisease domains and complications; follows a strict,transparent, and exhaustive systematic approach by,for example, including MeSH and non-MeSH terms;presents clinimetric information and—for the ﬁrsttime, to our knowledge—the technology readiness lev-el (TRL
10of every system reported in the studies eval-
uated; and provides a spreadsheet of these dataextracted from the papers.
After reading this article, cl inicians, people with Par-
kinson’s disease (PwP), and other stakeholders will havean overview of how quantitative assessments of PD havedeveloped during the course of the recent decade ofinnovation, what the options are to date, and what wecan expect in the near future from these technologies.To fulﬁll this latter purpose in particular, a list of sys-tems that are close to being translated into practical useis provided. In addition, the ab ove-mentioned systematic
spreadsheet containing the extracted information on theevaluated systems can serve as a living document thatwill be regularly updated by the authors. Interested read-ers are encouraged to use this resource to complementthe manuscript, which in fact can only provide some ini-tial steps of analysis.
Methods
A systematic search for arti cles published between Jan-
uary 1, 2005, and January 4, 2016, was conducted in 2electronic databases (PubMe d/Medline and Web of Sci-
ence). Using a Boolean search structure, 3 blocks of key-words were introduced and connected. The ﬁrst blockwas related to the disease (“ Parkinsonian Disorders,”
“Parkinson( /C19s) disease,” “Parkinson Disease, Secondary,”“Basal Ganglia Diseas es,” “Parkinsonism” ). The second
block included 45 technology terms related to PD assess-ment (eg, “ Technology /-ies ,” “Diagnostic Techniques,
Neurological ,” “Assessment ,” “Patient Outcome Asses-
sment ,” “ Accelerometer ,” “ Smartphone ”). The third
block was composed of different keywords describing
12 disease domains. These 12 domains were based on
clinical (eg, cardinal PD features) and technical reason-ing and on previous reviews.
2,9,11,12Six domains referred
to motor aspects (and are discussed separately in theResults section), 5 to nonmotor aspects, and 1 totreatment-related complic ations (eg, wearing-off and
dyskinesias). Table 1 provides an overview of the num-
ber of studies investigating these domains. The vastmajority of the identiﬁed and evaluated referencesreferred to motor aspects; therefore, the focus of the ini-tial analyses in this manuscript is on these domains.Nonmotor features and treat ment-related complications
were relatively underrepresented and are therefore not
discussed in detail. Papers that were not covered bythese 12 domains were collected in a miscellaneous cate-gory. This category includes p latforms (eg, telemonitor-
ing and telemedicine systems) , studies evaluating driving
skills, and a breath test to distinguish PwP from con-trols. No detailed results are reported for this category
because of its heterogeneity. A complete description of
the search structure and keywords used is provided inthe supplementary material section.TABLE 1. New technologies for the assessment of

2 Movement Disorders, Vol. 00, No. 00, 2016The following 3 steps were then performed (Figure 1):
/C15Identiﬁcation step: A total of 6,874 papers in the
Web of Science and 6,804 in PubMed/Medlinewere identiﬁed. After eliminating duplicates,
9,503 papers entered the next step.
/C15Screening step: One author (A.S.F.) screened the
titles and abstracts. The criteria for the articles
included in the next step were (i) use of an NAM-
PD, (ii) published in English, and (iii) used in
humans.
The exclusion criteria were the following: (i) the use
of only questionnaires/scales, (ii) electromyography,(iii) electroencephalography, (iv) imaging techniques,
(v) molecular diagnostic/therapeutic methods, (vi)
genetic tests, (vii) established speech recognition sys-
tems (ie, computerized speech lab), (viii) new develop-
ments in deep brain stimulation (DBS), and (ix)
magnetic transcranial stimulation. A total of 848
articles entered the next step.
/C15Evaluation step: This step was performed by 7
authors (A.S.F., M.E., C.G., D.S., M.A.H.,J.M.T.v.U., and J.D.) using a standardized web-
based form designed by A.S.F. (http://bit.ly/pd-
technologies). The full text of the 848 articles
were evaluated. Articles underwent a basic evalu-ation (author, journal, volume, pages, year, and
type of article) and were not evaluated more
extensively (and were not included in the analysisof this review) if they (i) were reviews (n 539),
(ii) reported a therapeutic application of NAM-
PD (n 565), (iii) did not include NAM-PD
(n5129), and (iv) were not used to assess PD
(n527).
From the remaining 588 original articles, the type of
NAM-PD used and the type of researcher using theNAM-PD (developers vs nondevelopers) were deﬁned.The use of an NAM-PD by a nondeveloper reinforced
its validation because it conﬁrmed that the NAM-PD
can be applied in different settings. In addition, its useby a nondeveloper usually indicates that a system ismore ready to be used. Moreover, demographic char-
acteristics (eg, sample size, stage of the disease, inclu-
sion of a control group, and patients with other

Movement Disorders, Vol. 00, No. 00, 2016 3diseases) were extracted. Then, the clinimetric charac-
teristics were evaluated. The selection of clinimetric
characteristics was based on the literature13-16and
included accuracy (ie, the degree to which a measure-ment represents the true value of the attribute being
measured, eg, by providing sensitivity and speciﬁcity
measures
17, agreement (ie, how well a test measures
the event of interest when compared with a standard,eg, by using Bland-Altman analyses,
18intraclass corre-
lation coefﬁcients,17and Kappa values17, responsive-
ness (sensitivity to change), and repeatability (thestability of the metric over time in a population with-out an expected change). Despite being used in many
studies, pure statistical correlations (ie, Spearman’s
Rho, Pearson’s R,o r r
2from regression models) were
not considered adequate to test the clinimetric proper-
ties of an NAM-PD and hence are not reported in the
results.17,19
Moreover, as mentioned previously, we extracted
information about the TRL of each original article
included in the full evaluation. The TRL scale was
developed by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and has recently been adapted by theEuropean Commission for the Horizon 2020 initia-
tive
10(Supplementary Table). This scale can be
applied by different stakeholders (eg, researchers, clini-cians, patients, regulatory and funding agencies, and
industrial partners) as a tool to determine how close a
technology is to being translated and for what use. Itsuse in biomedical applications has recently begun.
Development of the Systematic
Spreadsheet and Its Proposed Use
Detailed information about all 848 evaluated
articles is available at http://bit.ly/pd-technologies-
database. The systematic table derived from our evalu-ation is shared publicly for several purposes. First,interested readers are offered the opportunity to inves-
tigate any facet of the current state of NAM-PD
because the analyses presented in this manuscript arenecessarily limited to certain meta aspects and cannot
provide detailed answers on all aspects. Second, the
authors of the evaluated technologies can peer reviewthe information systematized by our group. In case ofany inconsistency, we are prepared to adapt the
spreadsheet accordingly. Third, it can serve as a living
document: Because the form used is also shared athttp://bit.ly/pd-technologies, any upcoming studies areoffered the opportunity to be included in this spread-
sheet. To provide an example of the opportunities the
spreadsheet provides, we focus in the Results sectionon the presentation of frequency, type of technologyused, demographic aspects, clinimetric properties, and
TRL aspects of studies sorted by different motor fea-
tures. In addition, we include a paragraph each onnonmotor aspects and treatment complications. Thedata are presented as absolute numbers and, in paren-
theses, the percentages of the total of all studies that
provided the information of interest.
Results
Of the 588 fully evaluated articles, 208 (35%)
reported on the validation of NAM-PD by developers,
183 (31%) on NAM-PD performance evaluated bynondevelopers, 157 (27%) on mathematical algorithms,and 40 (7%) on future NAM-PD platforms/ideas.
Studies using wearable NAM-PD covered a relevant
proportion of the research performed in this ﬁeld (211[37%] included this type of technology), and the num-ber of published studies showed a substantial relativeincrease during the period evaluated. For example,
wearable NAM-PD were used in 3 (18%) of the stud-
ies published in 2005 and in 38 (44%) of the studiespublished in 2015. Of the studies, 45 (8%) conﬁrmedtheir results in a different dataset.
Basic disease severity information using Hoehn and
Yahr stages was reported in 247 (42%) of the studies.PwP in stage 2 were most often included (in 216 ofthose studies), followed by those in stage 3 (193), 2.5(154), 1 (120), 4 (77), and 5 (11).
The ages of the participants were included in 394
(76%) of the studies that tested individuals, and 110studies (20%) included information on the statisticalassumptions (eg, whether the data followed a Gauss-
ian distribution).
The technologies used were accelerometers and
gyroscopes alone or combined, which we categorizedas inertial measurement units (IMUs), digitizing tab-
lets, optoelectronic systems, electromagnetic trackers,
force plates, virtual reality systems, software-basedtechnologies, smartphones, audio recorders, insoles,computer vision systems, smart gloves, videogameconsoles and ad hoc solutions.

groups was between 50 and 80 years in all studies.
Clinimetric Properties. Of the studies, 18 (15%) per-
formed data diagnostics prior to conducting any statis-
tical analyses. The most frequently reported referencestandard was the UPDRS-III, which was employed in41 (34%) of the studies, followed by expert diagnosis(eg, classiﬁcation of PD according to established crite-ria) in 36 (30%) studies.
The accuracy of the NAM-PD was reported in 45

ABSTRACT
Objective: We aimed to identify and analyze the characteristics of the 100 most highly-cited papers in the
research field of deep brain stimulation (DBS).Methods: The Web of Science was searched for highly-cited papers related to DBS research. The number
of citations, countries, institutions of origin, year of publication, and research area were noted and
analyzed.Results: The 100 most highly-cited articles had a mean of 304.15 citations. These accrued an average of
25.39 citations a year. The most represented target by far was the subthalamic nucleus (STN). These articles
were published in 46 high-impact journals, with Brain (n¼10) topping the list. These articles came from
11 countries, with the USA contributing the most highly-cited articles ( n¼29); however, it was the
University of Toronto ( n¼13) in Canada that was the institution with the most highly-cited studies.
Conclusions: This study identified the 100 most highly-cited studies and highlighted a historical perspec-
tive on the progress in the field of DBS. These findings allow for the recognition of the most influentialreports and provide useful information that can indicate areas requiring further investigation.ARTICLE HISTORY

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that
was first described in the 1950s1and over the next few decades
neurosurgeons tried to explore the possible therapeutic value of
electrode implantation with chronic recording and stimulation in
a small number of patients for numerous indications.2The mod-
ern era of therapeutic DBS, however, was heralded by the teamof Benabid, Pollak and their colleagues in a 1987 report.
3Over
the past several decades, with the approval of the United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DBS has become the
major growth area for the treatment of severe Parkinson ’s dis-
ease, essential tremor, dystonia and obsessive-compulsive dis-order.
4,5Although these applications are not yet FDA-approved,
recent interest has begun to focus on the clinical application of
DBS to other psychiatric and affective disorders, particularly
post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, as well as epi-lepsy.
6–8The exact mechanism of action of DBS remains uncer-
tain, but the use of this technique for an increasing number ofdisorders has brought dramatic and lasting benefits to patients.

The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) initiated “Science
Citations ”as a systematic approach to evaluate the impact of sci-
entific journals or researchers according to the number of times
the work has been cited.10This type of analysis has been applied
to the literature of various specialties and research areas.11–15In
addition, several journals publish their own journal citation clas-sics.
16,17In the field of neurosurgery, an analysis of highly-cited
papers dealing with functional and stereotactic neurosurgery,18
traumatic brain injury,19aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage,20
and skull base procedure21have all been studied. Little is cur-
rently known, however, about the most frequently cited articlesthat are specifically related to DBS research. Therefore, thepurpose of this study was to identify the 100 most highly-cited
articles pertaining to DBS and related research, in an effort toreveal important contributions to the literature in this promisingfield.
Materials and methods
Thomson Reuter ’s Web of Science was queried through the
Harvard Library Portal, on one specific day, June 30th, 2016, tominimize changes in citation number as much as possible, for allarticles relating to DBS. Different combination of the words“DBS ”,“deep brain stimulation ”,“intracranial ”,“subcortical ”,
“electrostimulator ”,“neurostimulator ”,“neuropacemaker ”,“brain
pacemaker ”,“depth lead implantation ”and “stimulator generator ”
were used and results were ranked by the number of citations.The term “cortical lead implantation ”was also used as a search
term in order to exclude papers dealing with implantation ofneurostimulators in the cortex. Whenever possible, the full textsof these reports were mainly obtained by PubMed, EMBASE, andMedline. When full-text articles were not available, onlineabstracts were relied upon.
Data inclusion criteria were: (a) peer-reviewed articles on DBS
research published and indexed in the Web of Science; (b) typeof article: original research articles and review articles. Exclusioncriteria were: (a) patents, books, manuals and non-biomedicalpublications, conference abstracts and case reports; (b) articlesfocusing on specific diseases, regardless of whether they men-tioned DBS as a potential treatment.
The 100 most highly-cited articles were then identified
based on the number of citations. Owing to differences in

Articles were selected by reading the abstract to gauge whetherthey were related to DBS, and the following data were
abstracted from each article that met our criteria: title, year of
publication, last corresponding author and his/her first institu-tion, country of origin, journal name, number of citations,type of study, research topic and keywords of study. Statistical
analysis was performed using R version 3.2.3 (Wooden
Christmas-Tree). Mean and standard error (SE) were used forcitations comparison, significant differences were identified
using a non-parametric ANOVA analysis with an alpha level
of 0.05. CiteSpace v4.0 was used to visualize the trends andpatterns in DBS research.

Results
The top 10 most highly-cited articles on DBS research are pre-
sented ( Table 1 ), while the full list of the 100 most highly-cited
articles are listed in Supplemental Materials (Table S1) in
descending order by total number of citations. The 100 papers
obtained a mean of 304.15 (SE 19.14) citations per article, withthe top one receiving 1408 citations (Mayberg et al., 2005)
25
and the least highly-cited article receiving 168 citations(Vidailhet et al., 2007).
26Annually, the 100 highly-cited articles
received an average of 25.39 (SE 1.62) citations per paper
(range, 8.56 to 117.33).
Years of publication
The years of publication in our sample ranged from 1991 to
2013 ( Figure 1 ), with 72 studies having been published between
2000 and 2009, 17 studies before 1999, and 11 after 2010.There was a peak in the number of highly-cited studies after
2002.Countries of origin and institutions
While the 100 articles originated in 11 different countries
(Figure 2 ), most ( n¼29) were from the USA, followed by France
(n¼26), Canada ( n¼14), Germany ( n¼11), England ( n¼7),
Netherlands ( n¼3) and Italy ( n¼3). Belgium, Spain, and
Switzerland each had two highly-cited studies, whereas SouthKorea contributed one study. Even though we placed no language
restrictions on our searches, we found that all 100 studies were
published in English-language journals.
These articles originated from 49 universities, hospitals, and
clinics. Six institutions were responsible for three or more
articles, led by the University of Toronto ( n¼13). The six
research institutions with the most highly-cited articles are listed
inFigure 3 .
Journal distribution and study field
The top 100 highly-cited articles were published in 46 journals,
most appeared in Brain (n ¼10), followed by Neurology and
Journal of Neurosurgery (n¼9, each). New England Journal of
Medicine (n¼8) is the highest impact factor journal in the list
(Table 2 ).
Study fields
Of the 100 articles, 19 were review articles, 81 were clinical
human studies covering different stimulation sites. Originalarticles had more average citation numbers (310.52, SE 23.17)
than review articles (277.0, SE 19.52), but the difference was not
significant ( P¼0.495). Parkinson ’s disease (PD) received the
most attention, while the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was the
most preferred stimulation target ( Table 3 ).Table 1. The top 10 of 100 most highly-cited DBS articles.

Discussion
DBS is a neuromodulation technique that targets specific struc-
tures in the brain. With both technological and conceptualadvances, the field of DBS has grown exponentially during thepast decade. In 2012, Lipsman and Lozano defined the top 100
highly-cited studies in stereotactic and functional neurosurgery.
18
Of them, 13 studies were specific to DBS, with treatment of
movement disorders representing the largest proportion of paperswith 31 total studies. In our study, we identified the 100 mosthighly-cited articles focusing specifically on DBS. Although older
publications have more years to accumulate citations and are
therefore often overrepresented in top 100 lists, our analysisshowed a peak in the number of studies after 2002. In that year,
STN and GPi stimulation were approved by the FDA for PDtreatment. Apart from FDA approval of thalamic DBS for essen-
tial tremor and PD-related tremor in 1997, this 2002 peak corre-
lates well with a major trend in clinical movement disorderstreatment practice to refer patients for DBS. This likely accounts
for why the 2000s was the most productive period for DBS
research.
The country of origin for the papers we identified is most fre-
quently the USA; furthermore, half of the corresponding institu-tions are located in the USA. While this is similar to other fields
of neurosurgery research,
19–21the dominant position of the USA
is less prominent in our list than in other studies. Our listincludes a larger proportion (71 %) of international articles,
reflecting the diversity of countries contributing to DBS research.
Brain, Neurology, and Journal of Neurosurgery, three high
impact journals, published most of the highly-cited articles. The
coverage of these journals spans across neuroscience, neurology,

Figure 2. Distribution of country origin for the 100 most highly-cited DBS research articles.BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY 589and neurosurgery, and they are also flagship journals in their
own specialties, respectively. It is noteworthy that DBS hasbroad applicability and relevance to multiple disciplines, andneuroscientists, neurologists and neurosurgeons all madegreat contributions. Furthermore, highly-cited DBS studies tendedto cluster in broadly applicable, typically higher impact publica-tions, such as NEJM andLancet Neurology .
Our co-word frequency cluster analysis revealed that the areas
of most interest in the field of DBS are PD and its related stimu-lation targets including STN, basal ganglia, and the limbic system.As the primary clinical use of DBS has been PD, the work relatedto PD made up the vast majority of cited studies ( n¼45).
Advanced PD has become the best studied and most commonindication for DBS and a variety of targets have been utilized. Ofthe 45 studies, 38 related to STN stimulation and 14 related toGPi, which confirms that these areas are the two most commontargets for DBS, both of which are components of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.
27Stimulation of these sites
has been associated with significant improvements in the cardinalmotor signs of PD, including tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity.
4
Five studies in our list disclosed stimulation of the ventral
intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus is highly effective forthe treatment of tremor, especially in patients with PD-relatedtremor or in essential tremor patients. However, Vim stimulationlacks significant positive effect on the rigidity, bradykinesia, andgait and postural disturbances associated with PD.
28This reason
may explain why the majority of PD patients are treated withinterventions in the STN or GPi, as these targets allow forimprovement in all the cardinal features of PD. In contrast, VimDBS has unequivocal functional benefits in patients with essentialtremor.
29
DBS also offers the attractive potential to directly modulate
the affective brain circuitry which may underly some neuro-psychiatric illnesses. Our study revealed reports proposing fourdifferent DBS targets for depression. For instance, on our list, themost highly-cited study of treatment-resistant depression, pub-lished in Neuron in 2006, with corresponding authors Dr.
Mayberg and Dr. Lozano at the University of Toronto, describedthe application of chronic DBS to the subgenual cingulate whitematter and how it could effectively reverse symptoms in treat-ment-resistant depression. This article was also ranked first in theannual citations list, with 129.4 citations per year.
As the field obtains a better and more thorough understand-
ing of the pathophysiology of neurologic and psychiatric disor-ders, newer and more specific targets are being tested withvarying success, including those relating to obsessive-compulsivedisorder, Tourette ’s syndrome, epilepsy, cluster headaches, and
Alzheimer ’s disease.
30–34Nevertheless, while the results have
largely been positive, unfortunately, no large scale randomizedcontrolled trials have been performed and evidence in this area islimited to small case series at best.
35In addition, at present, the
electric field generated by DBS is applied indiscriminately to allthe neural elements surrounding the electrode; this can some-times result in undesirable adverse effects. Furthermore, themechanism of action of DBS is not well understood and remainsa research priority, so a better understanding of basic conceptsshould be encouraged and development of new techniques thatpermeate into clinical practice are needed to make DBS a moreversatile and successful therapeutic option.
Our study has several limitations common to all bibliometric
analyses. First, as older studies have more time to accumulatecitations,
36articles that were published more recently will have a
shorter exposure to the medical community.37Thus, comparing
raw citation counts for articles published from different timeperiods is problematic. We have attempted to adjust for thisthrough the use of annual citation rate analysis for each

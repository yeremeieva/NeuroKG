Telerehabilitation ABSTRACT  
Background: and purpose: Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience persistent 
physical and psychological symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the effects of pulmonary telerehabilitation 
(PTR) combined with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on the physical and psychological outcomes of dis-
charged patients with COVID-19. 
Materials and methods: This randomised, assessor-blinded, parallel-group study was conducted in hospitals 
affiliated with Qom University of Medical Sciences between May and October 2021. Discharged COVID-19 pa-
tients aged 18–65 years were randomly assigned to two groups of 26 patients each. The experimental group 
underwent PTR and PMR for six weeks, while the comparison group received PTR alone. Primary (functional 
capacity) and secondary (dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life) outcomes were 
evaluated at baseline and after six weeks. 
Results: The experimental group showed significantly higher sleep quality (P 0.001, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.20 –4.09) and significantly lower fatigue (P 0.041, 95% CI: 4.79 –5.25) and anxiety (P 0.001, 95% CI: 
1.21 –4.47) than the comparison group. No between-group differences were observed in terms of other outcomes 
(P F0.05). 
Conclusion: PTR coupled with PMR was more effective for promoting sleep quality and alleviating anxiety and 
fatigue than PTR alone.   
1.Introduction 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially reported in 
Wuhan, China, but quickly spread worldwide, triggering a global 
pandemic [1]. Patients with COVID-19 show great diversity in symptom 
severity; while the majority of patients are asymptomatic or develop 
only mild influenza-like symptoms, hospitalisation is required in cases 
with severe symptoms [2,3]. The majority of discharged patients with 
COVID-19 experience persistent physical and psychological symptoms, 
including dyspnoea, fatigue, anxiety, depression, decreased functional 
capacity, and poor sleep quality [4–6], which can cause deconditioning 
and a lower quality of life [7]. Therefore, providing appropriate interventions to treat persistent symptoms and prevent complications in 
these patients after discharge is crucial [8]. 
Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective intervention for preventing 
deterioration of pulmonary and physical functions [9,10]. Social 
distancing policies adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce 
the spread of the infection have restricted access to outpatient rehabil -
itation programs for patients with COVID-19. Therefore, tele-
rehabilitation was recommended for patients with COVID-19 [11,12]. A 
recent randomised controlled trial showed that pulmonary rehabilita -
tion is effective for improving respiratory function, quality of life, and 
anxiety in patients with COVID-19 [13]; nevertheless, given older adults 
as the target population, the results cannot be generalized to all age

2groups. The effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on sleep quality and 
fatigue, the most prevalent symptoms in patients with COVID-19, have 
not been investigated. 
Recent studies have shown that including complementary interven -
tion to conventional care can improve psychological symptoms in pa-
tients with COVID-19 [14,15]. Liu et al. [16] found that progressive 
muscle relaxation (PMR) reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality in 
patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The PMR is a simple 
self-management and systematic relaxation technique that can achieve 
deep relaxation. Research has shown that PMR reduces fatigue and 
depression and improves sleep quality in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) [17–19]. Indeed, a previous prospective cohort study 
recommended the use of interventions to alleviate both physical and 
psychological symptoms of COVID-19 [20], which can be achieved using 
PMR coupled with pulmonary telerehabilitation (PTR). 
Given the limited data on the effects of interventions on persistent 
post-discharge symptoms in COVID-19, further studies are required to 
evaluate the efficacy of complementary interventions on symptoms 
[21]. To the best of our knowledge, the effects of PTR coupled with PMR 
on post-discharge outcomes have not yet been investigated in patients 
with COVID-19. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the 
effects of PMR coupled with PTR on functional capacity, anxiety, 
depression, fatigue, dyspnoea, quality of life and sleep quality compared 
to PTR alone, in discharged patients with COVID-19. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Trial design and setting 
This study was an assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial with 
two parallel treatment arms, conducted in hospitals affiliated with the 
Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom, Iran, between May 2021 and 
October 2021. The study was performed in accordance with the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT 2010) guidelines 
[22]. 
2.2. Participants 
Participants were selected from hospitals affiliated with Qom Uni-
versity of Medical Sciences by screening the hospital database. The in-
clusion criteria were age 18–65 years, COVID-19 confirmed by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, one day after discharge from the 
hospital and access to the Internet and video call. The exclusion criteria 
were pregnancy, re-hospitalisation, history of stroke, multiple sclerosis, 
chronic pulmonary and kidney conditions, uncontrolled diabetes or 
hypertension, cardiovascular diseases including uncontrolled arrhyth -
mias, and severe neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barre 
syndrome. 
2.3. Randomisation 
Permuted-block randomisation with a block size of four was per-
formed to randomly assign eligible participants to an experimental 
group receiving both PTR and PMR, and a comparison group receiving 
only PTR [23]. The blocks were randomly stacked using a Google 
random number generator. Random allocation was performed by an 
individual blinded to the grouping and the randomisation list was placed 
in sealed envelopes. 
2.4. Blinding 
The outcome assessor was blinded, unaware of the study objectives, 
and was not informed of the group assignment. 2.5. Intervention 
The exercises were taught to the experimental and comparison 
groups in one face-to-face session. The participants were advised to 
perform the exercises at home for six weeks and received descriptions 
and videos of each exercise through WhatsApp messenger. Two sessions 
per week were conducted under the supervision of a physiotherapist via 
video call [13,24]. Both groups performed PTR exercises once a day for 
five days per week [25,26]. In the experimental group, PMR exercises 
were performed twice a day (morning and night) for five days a week 
[16,17,27]. In both groups, patient adherence was assessed using daily 
text messages. 
2.5.1. Comparison group 
The six-week training program in the comparison group comprised 
breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing, pursed lip 
breathing, chest expansion, and deep breathing with arm movement. 
These exercises were performed in three sets of ten repetitions each. 
Strength training for large muscles included squats, standing heel-rise, 
shoulder abduction, shoulder flexion, shoulder horizontal adduction 
and extension, and elbow flexion and extension. Three sets of strength 
exercises were performed with a 2-min rest between sets of ten repeti -
tions. The upper limb exercises began with an external load. The 
external load for each muscle group was ten repetitions maximum and 
progressively increased by 5–10% per week [28]. Aerobic exercises 
included walking and upper-limb exercises. The six-week daily aerobic 
exercises with a rest interval, if needed, began at 10 min and increased to 
30 min depending on the patient’s tolerance [29]. The intensity of these 
exercises was determined based on the Borg scale (moderate-intensity 
score: 3–4). Moreover, the speed of walking and upper limb aerobic 
exercises increased according to this scale over six weeks [30,31]. 
2.5.2. Experimental group 
PMR and PTR were performed in the experimental group. PMR lasted 
15–20 min based on the modified Jacobson’s method proposed by 
Bernstein [27]. The techniques, including contraction and relaxation of 
the 16 main muscle groups, were explained to the patients, who were 
placed in a supine position and were asked to focus on a single muscle 
group. Contraction of each muscle group was performed for 5–7 s and 
the patients were asked to focus on the feeling of contraction, and on 
muscle relaxation for 30–40 s. Each muscle group contracted during 
deep inhalation, and relaxed during exhalation. All the muscle groups, i. 
e., the right and left hands and forearms, right and left biceps, upper and 
lower sections of the face, neck, back, abdomen, right and left thighs, 
right and left ankles, and feet, were contracted and relaxed in all sessions 
[18,19,27]. 
2.6. Outcome measures 
The primary outcome was functional capacity, while secondary 
outcomes included dyspnoea, fatigue, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, 
quality of life, and health status. Outcomes were evaluated before and 
after the six-week intervention. Variables such as functional capacity, 
dyspnoea, and fatigue were also evaluated at the end of two weeks. 
The 6-min walk test (6 MWT) was performed face-to-face according 
to the guidelines of the European Respiratory Society and the American 
Thoracic Society to evaluate functional capacity. The test was conducted 
at the Physiotherapy Department of the Qom University of Medical 
Sciences hospitals in a straight corridor with a hard surface. The par-
ticipants wore comfortable clothes, performed no exercise during the 2 h 
preceding the test, and sat on a chair near the test site 10 min before 
beginning the test [32]. The beginning and the end of the 15-m route 
were marked. The patients were then asked to stand and assume a po-
sition on the starting line. As the participants began to walk, an elec-
tronic timer set at 6 min was started. In case of inability to continue for 6 
min or severe dyspnoea, they were asked to sit on the chair and the timer A. Hajibashi et al.

3was stopped. SpO 2 and heart rate were monitored before and after the 
test using a fingertip pulse oximeter (Yimi Life, Model:YM101). The total 
distance walked in meters was recorded [33]. Furthermore, dyspnoea 
was measured at the end of the 6 MWT using the Borg scale (0–10) [34]. 
The Persian version of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was used to 
assess fatigue. The FSS is a nine-item scale. The items are scored on a 
scale of 0–7, with a total score ranging from 9 to 63. The higher the 
score, the higher the fatigue severity [35]. The validity of the fatigue 
severity scale was confirmed in Iran, and its test-retest reliability coef-
ficient was calculated as 0.78 –0.95 [36]. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality. The PSQI is a 19-item 
index. The items are scored on a scale of 0–3, with a total score 
ranging from 0 to 21; the higher the score, the more severe the sleep 
disorder [37]. Moghadam et al. [38] evaluated the validity and reli-
ability of this index and confirmed the psychometric properties of the 
Persian version of the PSQI by calculating Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.77. The 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate 
anxiety (seven items) and depression (seven items). The HADS is a 
14-item scale. The items are scored on a four-point scale of 0–3, yielding 
a total score of 0–21, with higher scores indicating worse depression and 
anxiety [39]. The validity and internal consistency of the Persian version 
of this self-reported rating scale were previously confirmed in an Iranian 
population [40]. The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was 
used to evaluate the quality of life. SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire with 
eight subscales. The subscales include physical functioning, physical 
role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional 
role, and mental health. The total score of this questionnaire ranges from 
0 to 100, with lower scores denoting lower quality of life [41]. Inves -
tigating the internal consistency (reliability) of the Persian version of the 
SF-36, Montazeri et al. [42] confirmed the reliability of all dimensions of 
this questionnaire by calculating a Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.77 –0.90 except 
for vitality, which had a Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.65. Health status was 
evaluated using the 50-item St. George ’s Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ), which comprises three components, including symptoms, ac-
tivity, and impacts (on daily life). The possible score on this question -
naire ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater 
restrictions [43]. Fallah-Tafti et al. [44] previously measured the val-
idity and reliability of the Persian version of this questionnaire in pa-
tients with COPD and calculated a Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.93 for the 
entire questionnaire. All self-reported assessment tools, i.e., FSS, PSQI, 
HADS, SF-36, and SGRQ were sent as Google forms to the participants 
via WhatsApp messenger at the assessment time points and completed 
by the participants in online sessions under the supervision of an 
evaluator. 
2.7. Statistical analysis 
2.7.1. Sample size calculation 
A priori sample size per group was calculated as 26 based on the data 
from a previously published RCT with 6 MWT as the primary outcome 
[13], and a test power of 80%, alpha of 5%, and an effect size of 0.71 for 
between-group differences using G*power software version 3.0.10. 
Considering a dropout rate of 10%, the sample size was set to 58 (29 per 
group). 
2.7.2. Data analysis 
Statistical analysis were performed using SPSS-19 with the signifi -
cance level set at P D0.05. The Shapiro –Wilk test was used to investigate 
normality, and Levene ’s test was used to assess variance homogeneity. 
As the data were normally distributed, parametric measures were used. 
The independent t-test was used to investigate between-group differ -
ences at baseline and at the end of the 6th week, while the paired t-test 
was used to examine within-group differences. In addition, repeated 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (two groups, three times) was 
conducted to examine within- and between-group differences for the 
variables that were assessed three times (fatigue, 6 MWT, and dyspnoea). The post-hoc Bonferroni test was used to investigate the 
significant group ×time interactions. The between-group effect sizes 
(ES) were calculated using Cohen ’s d. The ES was considered small (d 
0.20), medium (d 0.50), or large (d 0.80) [45]. 
2.8. Ethical considerations 
This study was registered in the International Database of Clinical 
Trials (clinicaltrials.gov ) (NCT04741282) and approved by the Research 
Ethics Committee of the Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 
Iran (IR.IUMS.REC.1399.1119). All participants were briefed on the 
intervention, assured of their right to withdraw from the study at their 
own discretion and of the confidentiality of their information through 
coding the questionnaires, and then asked to sign consent forms. The 
comparison group underwent PMR after the completion of the study. 
3.Results 
Patients were enrolled between May 2021 and August 2021; 107 
discharged patients with COVID-19 were assessed for eligibility, of 
whom 43 did not meet the inclusion criteria and six declined to 
participate. In total, 58 patients with COVID-19 were included after 
hospital discharge. Of these, 52 completed the intervention. Two pa-
tients withdrew from each group before completing all sessions. One 
patient was excluded from the comparison group due to re- 
hospitalisation, and one in the experimental group due to relocation 
to another city. This information is presented in the CONSORT flow 
diagram (Fig. 1). 
3.1. Baseline characteristics 
Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the 
patients at baseline, suggesting no differences in any variable between 
the groups. 
3.2. Functional capacity 
The six-week intervention was found to significantly increase the 
distance walked in the 6 MWT in the experimental and comparison 
groups (P D0.001); nevertheless, statistically insignificant differences 
were observed between the groups (P 0.96) (Table 2). The between- 
group effect size was small after the intervention (ES D0.2). 
3.3. Dyspnoea 
Dyspnoea significantly decreased after the intervention in both 
groups according to the Borg dyspnoea scale (P D0.001); however, 
statistically insignificant differences were observed between the groups 
(p 0.812) (Table 2). The between-group effect size was small after the 
intervention (ES D0.2). 
3.4. Fatigue 
The fatigue severity scale showed significant reductions in fatigue in 
both the groups (P D0.001). Post-intervention fatigue was less severe in 
the experimental group than that in the comparison group (P 0.041). 
The between-group effect sizes were medium to large at two weeks (ES 
0.635) and six weeks (ES 0.792) after the baseline assessment. 
Significant group ×time interactions were also observed for fatigue 
severity (P 0.005) (Table 2). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed 
significant within-group differences in the experimental group between 
baseline and two weeks (P 0.003), and between baseline and six weeks 
(P D0.001). Despite the insignificant differences between baseline and 
two weeks later in the comparison group (P 0.999), the baseline was 
significantly different from six weeks later (P 0.043) (Fig. 2). Table 2 
presents the within-group and between-group differences in the A.

5variables assessed three times using repeated-measures ANOVA. 
3.5. Sleep quality 
Significant improvements were observed in the experimental (P D
0.001) and comparison (P 0.007) groups. Moreover, these improve -
ments were significantly greater in the experimental group than in the 
comparison group (P 0.001) (Table 3). 
3.6. Anxiety and depression 
Significant reductions were found in the post-intervention HADS 
scores in terms of anxiety (P D0.001) and depression in the experi -
mental (P D0.001) and comparison (P 0.02) groups. Statistically 
significant between-group differences were observed only in terms of 
anxiety, with the experimental group receiving a significantly lower 
score (P 0.001) (Table 3). 3.7. Quality of life 
Statistically significant within-group differences were observed in 
the SF-36 total score and the mental and physical subscales of the SF-36 
in both groups (P D0.001). However, no between-group differences 
were observed for these outcomes (Table 3). In addition, no between- 
group differences were found in terms of physical functioning, phys-
ical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, 
emotional role, and mental health as the eight health domains of this 
questionnaire (P F0.05). 
3.8. Health status 
The SGRQ suggested statistically significant post-intervention im-
provements in health status in both the groups (P D0.001). No between- 
group differences were observed in this regard (P 0.784). In addition, 
significant improvements in symptoms, activity, and impacts as sub-
scales of this questionnaire (P D0.001) were found in both groups 
(Table 3). Table 3 presents the between-group differences in the

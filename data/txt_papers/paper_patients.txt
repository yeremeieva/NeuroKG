Objective: To review and synthesise qualitative
research studies that have explored patients ’experience
of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in advanced
Parkinson’ s disease (PD).
Design: Systematic review and meta-synthesis of
7 original papers, using metaethnography.
Setting: Studies conducted in Denmark, France and
Sweden.
Participants: 116 patients who had undergone DBS
and 9 spouses of patients.
Results: Prior to surgery, the experience of advancing
PD is one of considerable loss and a feeling of loss ofcontrol. There are significant hopes for what DBS canbring. Following surgery, a sense of euphoria isdescribed by many, although this does not persist andthere is a need for significant transitions following this.
We suggest that normality as a concept is core to the
experience of DBS and that a sense of control may bea key condition for normality. Experience of DBS forpatients and spouses, and of the transitions that theymust undertake, is influenced by their hopes of whatsurgery will enable them to achieve, or regain(ie, a new normality).
Conclusions: There is a need for further qualitative
research to understand the nature of these transitions
to inform how best patients and their spouses can besupported by healthcare professionals before, duringand after DBS. In assessing the outcomes of DBS and
other treatments in advanced PD, we should consider
how to capture holistic concepts such as normality andcontrol. Studies that examine the outcomes of DBSrequire longer term follow-up.
INTRODUCTION
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is widely used
to treat a range of Parkinson ’s disease (PD)
symptoms, typically in advanced PD,
although its ef ﬁcacy has been tested in
earlier stages.1DBS is effective in improving
many motor and some non-motor symptoms.Meta-analysis
2of six randomised controlledtrials (RCTs) of DBS demonstrates signi ﬁcant
improvements in motor disability, activities ofdaily living, medication use, mental health,
mood, behavioural problems and quality of
life (QoL). However, measures of communi-cation, dementia and executive functioning
favoured medication controls.
Despite the overall effectiveness of DBS,
observational studies and subgroup analysesof trial data demonstrate that not all patients
report improvements in QoL. Daniels et al
3
found that 43% of patients showed no
improvement at 6 months, and Soulas et al4
found that 37% showed no improvement or
a decline in QoL. For composite indices and
individual domains of global disease speci ﬁc
(eg, Parkinson ’s Disease Questionnaire
(PDQ)-39), and generic QoL measures,there are aggregate improvements in motor
signs, mobility, activities of daily living, stigmaand bodily discomfort, but no improvement
or decline in social support, emotional well-
being, cognition and communication.

Studies that have quanti ﬁed patients ’and
spouses ’perceived outcome at 3 months
postsurgery show positive ratings in only 47%and 33% of patients and spouses, respect-
ively.

Most research informing debates about the ef ﬁcacy
and use of DBS is quantitative, using measurement and
ratings scales. Although Maier et al9and Lewis et al8used
qualitative data collection methods (interviews) with
patients and spouses, their accounts were quanti ﬁed to
categorise participants into positive or negative outcomeassessments. The only commonly cited exception to thisis the study by Agid et al
11which used semistructured
psychological interviews to explore contrasts in perspec-tives on improvement post-DBS between clinicians,patients and spouses.
Qualitative research provides in-depth description,
understanding and explanation of patients ’experi-
ence of disease and treatment. The value of qualitative
evidence as an adjunct to RCTs is well recognised,
with examples of qualitative research being used tocontextualise and understand trial observations.
12
Paralleling meta-analysis for quantitative studies, quali-tative synthesis techniques have been developed toanalyse the ﬁndings of primary qualitative research, to
identify commonality and difference in ﬁndings, and
to arrive at higher order interpretations and explan-ation of the subjective experience of disease and treat-
ment from a patient perspective.
13We sought to
synthesise existing qualitative research that has exam-
ined patients’ experiences and perspectives related to
DBS. In doing so, we wished to examine whether thisresearch might provide some further insight into thevariable and often negative assessment of QoL given
by patients and spouses soon after DBS, despite the
apparent overall effectiveness of the procedure asmeasured in RCTs.
METHODS
Literature searchesSeveral strategies were employed to maximise the identi-
ﬁcation of relevant literature.
14 15These included
searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE
In Process and EMBASE via Ovid); CINAHL via EBSCO;
Social Sciences Citation Index and Conference
Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) via Web of Scienceand CENTRAL Trials Register; the Database of Abstracts
of Reviews of Effects; and Health T echnology
Assessment Database all via Cochrane Wiley).Conference abstracts were searched via CPCI (see
above) and British Library ’s ZETOC and authors of con-
ference abstracts contacted. Reference lists of included
papers were also searched.Selection criteria
English language papers published in peer-reviewed
journals, which reported using qualitative methodologyto explore patients ’or spouses ’experiences of DBS for
the treatment of advanced PD, were included. Weincluded research (one paper) reporting spouses ’per-
spectives as it can help to illuminate the experiences of
patients. The searches (see online supplementary
appendix 1 for an example) applied no date limits (ie,went back to inception for each database and were run
to the end of February 2015). Searches were part of a
wider project and covered the broader topic of patients ’
and spouses ’experience of living with PD. A focus on
DBS was required for this subproject, and relevantpapers were highlighted during the wider screeningprocess. Papers had to report results of qualitative ana-
lysis based on qualitative data collection methods (eg,
interviews, focus groups, observations). We includedmultiple papers from the same data set as long as they
reported the interpretation of different research ques-
tions. Editorials, narrative reviews and papers whichreported the experience of living with advanced PD but
not speci ﬁcally in relation to DBS were excluded.
ScreeningFollowing the removal of duplicates, the titles and
abstracts of identi ﬁed articles were screened, with exclu-
sion of those not meeting the above selection criteria.
Full-text versions of the remaining articles were reviewed
by two authors ( JM and LLJ) and the list of papers tobe included in the synthesis ﬁnalised via consensus dis-
cussion ( ﬁgure 1).
Quality assessment
There remains signi ﬁcant discussion in the literature
around quality appraisal of studies included in qualita-
tive syntheses. In particular, there are debates about the
meaning of quality and validity, how to incorporate the
ﬁndings of studies considered to be of lower quality, and
the uncritical use of quality checklists.
16 17We assessed
both the methodological reporting and robustness ofeach study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) Qualitative Checklist,
18and also their concep-
tual richness. Following this process, it was decided thatall of the identi ﬁed studies would be adopted in the
current synthesis. Two studies
11 19which we rated as low
quality in terms of reporting (eg, due to a lack of speci-ﬁed detail regarding recruitment of participants and
analytical approach) were rated highly in terms of their
conceptual richness.

Analysis
Metaethnography
20was used to identify, translate and
interpret shared concepts across the papers. The aim
of this approach is interpretive rather than aggrega-
tive, and thus is concordant with the paradigm that
underpins the majority of primary qualitative researchthat syntheses are based on.
21Metaethnography is the
longest established tool for synthesising qualitativeresearch,
13 22and has been used with smaller bodies
of literature and, despite its label and origins, with
non-ethnographic studies.23We broadly followed the
seven-step process proposed by Noblit and Hare20and
also used in a worked healthcare example by Brittenet al:21(1) getting started; (2) deciding what is rele-
vant to the initial interest; (3) reading the studies; (4)
determining how the studies are related; (5) translat-ing the studies into one another; (6) synthesising
translations and (7) expressing the synthesis. Each
paper, in the form of the extracted document ( ﬁrst
a n ds e c o n do r d e rc o n s t r u c t s ) ,w a sa n n o t a t e di nd e t a i l
by JM and LLJ and then core concepts and the inter-
pretation of these discussed at length to develop theline of argument presented in this paper. Core con-
cepts were mapped across the papers to ensure that
convergent and divergent cases were considered.However, it became clear that the studies were broadly
concordant and suitable for the reciprocal translation
that underpins the line of argument developed. Thepaper by Haahr et al
24was used as an index paper to
help facilitate the translation of studies into eachother as it was judged to be both conceptually rich
and well reported.

THE EXPERIENCE OF DBS AND PD
Only one paper26provides an explicit focus on life prior
to late stage PD and consideration of DBS. We will not
describe these data or other qualitative research focus-
ing on the experience of living with PD outside the
context of DBS in detail as it has been summarisedpreviously.
29
We provide a brief descriptive overview of the chron-
ology of experience of DBS, before a detailed descrip-tion of the core cross-cutting themes ( normality, loss, loss
of control, transitions, hopes ) in our interpretation of this
chronology ( table 2). These themes are highlighted in
bold in the text.
THE CHRONOLOGY
Pre-DBSThere is a need for higher dosage and more frequent
medication with advancing PD and life is increasingly
focused on the disease and treatment.
27Although
patients are able to maintain some control via medica-
tion, this time of gradual disease progression is described
as a period of considerable loss(ﬁgure 2 ).11 19 24– 27
Eventually, advanced PD is characterised by unpredict-
ability and a feeling of loss of control19 24– 28as the effect-
iveness of medication diminishes. Studies that presentdata on pre-DBS perspectives indicate that surgery is
viewed as a ‘last resort ’
11 19 25 26and that the choice to
undergo DBS is not much of a choice at all:
I was ready for an operation when the rigidity and the
dyskinesia superseded each other, so that I did not getany good time in between. (Patient
25)
There appear to be signi ﬁcant hopes19 24– 28for what
the surgery can bring, hopes that are in ﬂuenced by this
experience of lossand loss of control .
Post-DBS
Immediately postsurgery, a sense of euphoria11 19 25 27 28
is reported by many patients, resulting from the newfound (or regained) sense of freedom initially affordedby the procedure. Haahr et al
24indicate that this persists
for some, but collectively the evidence describes a needfor signi ﬁcant transitions to a new disease state and life,
following this initial euphoria. Although Haahr et al

lution with their new disease state and life post-DBS, it is
unclear whether all, or what proportion of patients
manage successful transitions . However, those papers that
report an overall assessment indicate that, although not
uncomplicated, over time, the overall impacts of the
surgery are judged positively by patients.28
CORE THEMES AND THEIR INTER-RELATIONSHIPOur interpretation is that normality as a concept is a core
component of the experience of DBS and the meaning
of that for patients. In turn, control may be a key condi-
tion for a sense of normality , with loss of control precluding
that. Experience of DBS and the transitions post-DBS
link to hopes that the surgery will allow people to
achieve, or regain, normality in life. In turn, this should
be understood within the context of the seemingly irrev-
ocable lossand loss of control that patients, spouses and
those around them experience during late stage PD.
Normality
Normality
11 19 24 25 27 28is a concept present in the
descriptive accounts of ﬁndings, in the primary data
reported, and implicitly as the goal that patients andspouses strive towards during the transitions that theyundergo post-DBS. We propose that normality has a dual
meaning. First, normality as a state can be opposed to the
diseased state and the impacts of that diseased state, that
is, it represents a prediseased life. Patients seek to main-tain this using medication in the early stages of PD, via
control of the disease and its impacts. However, as PD
progresses, normality is also a descriptor for a state
whereby patients are able to maintain an adjusted life
which accommodates the disease. Normality is condi-
tional on perceived control over the disease and its man-
agement. In other words, loss of control , an inability to
predict and manage the impacts of the disease, meansthat patients and spouses can no longer maintain anysense of normality :
More than half of the couples experienced that nothing
was‘normal ’for a long period of adjustment [to stimula-
tion]. This put a strain on both parties and on their rela-tionship. (Author interpretation
27)
Loss and loss of control
Progressive PD results in loss. Impacts include impaired
physical function and ability to do things; unpredictabil-ity of everyday life and the associated inability to planahead ( lossof freedom); weakened social ties, friend-

tionships with spouses, for example, intimacy, joint
activities, independence a nd time for oneself, compan-
ionship.11 19 24 –27
There has been loss of many things. Loss of the person
you married, loss of abilities, loss of strength …Ih a v e
experienced social isolation. Having to ﬁnd a new iden-
tity, a new social life, a new way of living life …we have
talked about what possibilities we have. How can we com-
pensate for what we have lost? (Spouse27)
Late stage PD is characterised by perceived loss of
control over the disease and impacts of disease. There is
an increased lack of predictability. The resultant fear of
negative consequences of this loss of control (eg, going off
in public) places further constraints on patients and
spouses. The condition (control) that allows mainten-
ance of some sense of normality is removed from their
grasp, so that even ‘a new identity, social life and way of
living ’, as described above,27is compromised.
The ability to attain some perceived control post-DBS
may be crucial to transitions that must be undertaken in
order to allow patients and spouses to attain some senseof a (new) normality .
Transitions
Following the initial postsurgery euphoria,
11 19 25– 28for
many, there is a need to undergo wide ranging transi-
tions11 19 24 25 27 28in order to adjust to a post-DBS life.
Some patients report this as a decline, although it is
unclear whether this is a genuine physical decline or amanifestation of the realisation that DBS necessitates
complex transitions . These transitions are physical and
bodily, functional and activity-related, social and relation-
ships, and psychological.
Physical and bodily transitions include the need for
adjustments in stimulation parameters in order to estab-lish‘optimal ’settings in conjunction with medication,
with testing and retesting of these. For some, this is aprolonged process with a need for multiple hospitalvisits and adjustments:
After the setting, it feels good for a day or two, and after
that it starts to pull in my face, with pain in my chin.(Patient
28)
In some cases, this necessitates trade-offs, for example,
between settings which optimise motor function or
speech:
I have trouble speaking. I have to learn to live with that,
because if the stimulation is adjusted to improve myspeech, then I have trouble walking. (Patient
24)
This is also a time of testing the new boundaries and
limits of physical and functional ability and engagement
in activities.Social transitions include rede ﬁnition of the boundar-
ies of social activities and friendships. For some, relation-ships with spouses must also change. ‘Normal ’
relationships are likely to have been lost during disease
progression, as spouses take on and agree new roles
within a relationship— carer as well as partner. Following
surgery, couples may need to renegotiate roles. This is
clearly a potential source of strain within relationships
when consensus about new roles is dif ﬁcult to attain:
…[we] were [the] perfect couple, since the operation he
wants to live like a young man: going out, meeting new
people …it’s unbearable! I prefer him as he was before,
always nice and quiet. (Spouse11)
There are examples11 19 24 27of patients wanting to
re-establish former roles and feeling that spouses are
overprotective, as well as con ﬂicting expectations.
Spouses who see substantial improvements in motor
function are disappointed when partners do not change
behaviour accordingly. Patients report the persistence ofsymptoms and struggle with such physical transitions :
My wife cannot tell when I am feeling bad, and then she
thinks I am lazy. She starts fussing, telling me to get myact together …and I try, but when I am in pain or in
some other way cannot function, then there is nothing todo about it. (Patient
24)
Loss of initiative11 19 24 27is noted in several of the
papers. Despite improvement in motor disability, often
this is not re ﬂected in patients’ behaviour, for example,
they do not want to pursue new activities, or lack interest
in work where previously it was a focus;
Before, I was absolutely determined to carry on working.
For me, it was a way of ﬁghting the illness. I wanted to
show that I was still capable. After the surgery, I realisedthat there were more important things, like having time,or seeing my grandchildren grow up. (Patient
19)
Spouses are reported as drivers of change, encour-
aging patients to test the boundaries of their abilities,
although as above, this can be a source of tension where
change is not apparent:27
I am very alert that he doesn ’t get too comfortable …such
as he asks me to get him things and I tell him to get up
and get them himself. (Spouse27)
Patients must cope psychologically with these transi-
tions. There may be a hangover from the pre-DBS
period that was characterised by unpredictability and loss
of control , despite postsurgery improvements in motor
function. The fear of the consequences of unpredictabil-
ity may remain:
Even though I know my motor state is perfectly normal, I
just can ’t get rid of the thoughts I used to have, when I
was ill. I still have the same re ﬂexes to initiate walking

refuse invitations to go out because I imagine I ’ll have
freezing attacks and walking problems, even though it ’s
no longer the case. My body is cured but my mind is stillsick. (Patient
11)
This also appears to be a time when patients and
spouses have not regained control over the management
of the disease which is largely in the hands of the health-care professionals who guide the adjustment of stimula-
tion parameters.
Hope may be a key psychological contingency which
inﬂuences the experience of these transitions .
HopesAlthough only labelled explicitly in one of the papers as
a subtheme,
24hopes for the outcome and impact of DBS
are implicit in much of these data. In the face of a sig-
niﬁcant history of lossand loss of control in late stage PD,
hopes to counteract the progressive impact and decline
associated with the disease are strong:
I think it will be easier …that is the impression I get …I
think so …some talk of it as getting a new life [laughing]
…I don ’t need a new life, but an easier life wouldn ’tb e
so bad. (Patient26)
The evidence suggests that patients do not necessarily
know what to expect:
Nobody knows what happens after the operation, right?
It is easier to relate to taking tablets and then you can goon again, but we don ’t know after the operation …It is
like a new day 1. Like when I got ill —then life starts from
there …so this will happen again on the 19
th[date of
surgery] then life starts all over again …[laughs].
(Patient26)
However, this may not re ﬂect a lack of information or
understanding that sets ‘expectations ’too highly, as
much as hopes to regain what has been lost:
I have experienced an overall improvement. I can walk, Ican get in and out of bed, and I don ’t use my wheelchair
anymore …that I had expected more is my fault, looking
back, the expectations I had were unrealistic. There wereno grounds for the improvements I had hoped for. But Ihad read interviews with patients who had had the oper-ation, and they were all positive. They said nothing of the
other side of the coin. And I read it as this was a miracle
cure…and it is… but the miracles do stick to the ground.
(Patient
24)
There is also evidence of patients rejecting the cau-
tious counselling of expectations from healthcare profes-
sionals, in favour of post-DBS accounts that align withhopes for particular outcomes:
They [the doctors] say not to expect too much, but I
don’t know. I think it will be good. I know somebody whohas had it done and they are very satis ﬁed, so why
shouldn ’t I be? (Patient26)
Patients may wish for further improvements during
transitions via re ﬁnements in stimulation parameters:
Can’t you move the electrodes a bit, a millimetre or less?
Or at least increase the stimulation? I am sure it is pos-sible to improve the parameters so that I feel better.(Patient
11)
This may be inter-related with pre-DBS hopes for the
procedure which are not necessarily realised fully for
patients and spouses. In turn, there may be a need for
psychological resolution and realisation that this is ‘as
good as it gets ’in order to accommodate the post-DBS
state. Haahr et al24term this ‘reconciliation ’.
DISCUSSIONWe have synthesised seven studies.
11 19 24 –28At present,
this is a relatively small body of work, although it does
represent in-depth qualitative investigation with patients
from a range of settings and at a range of time points
after DBS. Three of the papers stem from the sameDanish data set.
24 26 27Additionally, one of these
papers24was key in the early stages of the synthesis as it
provided a conceptually rich account of the experienceof DBS that aided the translation of studies into one
another. Naturally, this requires re ﬂection as to whether
this one data set has skewed our synthesis and ultimately
the interpretation and line of argument presented here.
We do not believe this to be the case as the core con-
cepts identi ﬁed occur across the majority of the papers,
thereby strengthening the case for the interpretation
given. However, we acknowledge that there is a need for
further primary research in different and varied settingsand patient populations, to improve our knowledge in
this area. In addition, there is a need to further examine
spouses’ experiences and insights. Only one of the
papers we identi ﬁed explored this in detail,
27which is a
clear de ﬁcit of knowledge in this area. We included this
study as we felt that it was able to shed valuable light onthe experience of DBS, and also because other papers
reported the impacts of DBS on aspects of relationships
from a patient perspective. Two papers
11 19were rated
low quality based on methodological reporting but were
conceptually rich. We included these in the synthesis as
conceptual richness is recognised as a key indicator ofthe utility of individual studies for qualitative synthesis,
and for metaethnography in particular.
20
We suggest that normality is a core concept which facili-
tates understanding of the experiences of DBS. Normality
is a complex concept that has been used to understand
the patient experience of other diseases. For example,Sanderson et al
30have used it as an explanatory tool for
patients’ experience of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and it
has also been used to understand patient perspectiveson motor neuron disease (MND).
31Here, normality has

Protected by copyright. http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011525 on 23 June 2016. Downloaded from a dual meaning and describes both a prediseased state
and life, but also a state whereby patients and spouses
are able to adopt an adjusted life accommodating thedisease and its impacts. The latter has also been
described as a form of ‘normalisation ’of disease in
studies that focus on adaptation to chronic illness,
whereby patients come to see and treat the illness as
‘normal ’,
32 33developing iterative strategies in the
actions that they take in living with the illness. We
propose that a sense of control is a condition for this
form of normality in PD. Patients have lost this control in
late stage PD and do not regain it immediately following
surgery due to the complex multifaceted transitions that
they face while adjusting to the post-DBS disease state.Hopes to regain what has been lost as a result of the
illness and for further improvements via adjustment in
stimulation may be key psychological contingencies for
successfully negotiating these transitions , and attaining
what we have called a ‘new normality ’. This is similar to
what has been termed ‘resetting normality ’in RA and a
‘dynamic normality ’in MND.
30 31
This way of conceptualising post-DBS patient experi-
ence provides a potentially explanatory framework forsome of the observations in the trial and observationalquantitative evidence. While negative assessments
(eg, QoL; subjective ratings) by patients and spouses
post-DBS
3489may well have a biomedical component, it
is crucial to acknowledge the complex transitions for
patients and those around them. Patients are clearly notinexplicably struggling in the face of a seemingly miracu-lous recovery of motor function. Symptoms persist
post-DBS during the transitions that are undertaken.
Hopes may be key, and despite careful counselling and
information giving to patients, they may retain hopes for
the procedure that are unattainable. This has been
observed in the use of DBS for treatment-resistant depres-sion
34and previously in DBS for PD. For example,
Montel and Bungener (ref. 35, p. 109) comment:
…our clinical experience has led us to the conclusion
that for many patients with PD who are to be treated with
stimulation, their expectations are too unrealistic, whichaccounts for their disappointment 12 months later. Most ofthem consider the stimulation to be a “magic ”process that
is going to free them entirely from their physical impair-ment. When they are confronted with reality (namely, thatthey can be improved but not totally cured by stimulation),they are very disappointed. In fact, the problem is not thepresentation of information about DBS by neurologists butrather the way the candidates interpret it. Most often, can-didates “hear”what they want to hear, that is, that after the
stimulation, they will return to life as it was before PD.
This may be a consequence of the lossand loss of
control experienced prior to DBS, such that hopes to
regain a predisease normality may outweigh ‘reasoned ’
expectations for improvements.
Stimulation adjustment can be long and dif ﬁcult. The
prospect that such adjustment can realise furtherimprovements that are not yet apparent may prolong hopes
for outcomes (eg, normality ) that cannot be realised, pre-
venting patients from accommodating DBS as quickly as
they may otherwise do. Patients may also fear testing the
boundaries of their physical abilities, which is perhaps a
psychological hangover from the impacts of previousmotor function. This may not be immediately apparent to
healthcare professionals, or even spouses. The latter are
likely to be a key catalyst in change and support, but at thesame time, there is a need for patients and spouses to
adjust to new roles within their relationships.
Theﬁndings from meta-analysis, individual trial data
and observational studies are re ﬂected in this qualitative
research. Negative social support, emotional well-being
and communication outcomes seem well explained bythe qualitative data. Measurement of outcomes in the
short term (3 or 6 months) is likely to coincide with the
transitions described, impacting on patient-reported out-
comes, and implying that longer follow-up is required.
Also, if key holistic assessments of the impacts of DBS
are to be made, then outcome measures should ideallycapture concepts such as normality and control . The pre-
dominant primary outcome measure used in DBS trials,PDQ-39, measures items in eight domains (mobility,activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma,
social support, cognitions, communication and bodily
discomfort). Each of these domains can be interpretedwithin the qualitative evidence via patients’ and spouses ’
accounts of the impacts of DBS. This provides furthervalidation that PDQ-39 does measure items of import-ance to patients and spouses, and within the context of
DBS. While outcome measures such as PDQ-39 have
been developed using primary qualitative data (in-depthinterviews),
36our synthesis suggests that measures which
capture the impact of treatments on control and normality
may also prove useful.
At present, the body of qualitative evidence under-
pinning our knowledge of the experience and impactof DBS is small. Additional lo ngitudinal investigation of
the transitions described here is needed to further
understand and facilitate these transitions .T h i ss h o u l d
use mixed-methods research techniques featuring well-
designed qualitative investigation with patients and
spouses, alongside quantitative data. Key areas for
research are likely to include a focus on pre-DBS andpost-DBS information giving and support; the experi-
ence of the stimulation adjustment process post
surgery; the nature and role of social support duringtransitional periods including the impact on relation-
ships; and the role of professional support throughout
this period. Our ﬁndings also suggest the need for
further re ﬂection on the use of DBS earlier in PD pro-
gression, although this practice is currently beingdebated within the PD/DBS community.
37 38Using
DBS at an earlier stage, when patients are able to main-
tain some control and normality , may be a similarly dis-
ruptive experience with need for equivalent transitions
and loss of control during these.

Our synthesis identi ﬁesﬁve core concepts: normality, loss,
loss of control, transitions and hopes which facilitate our
understanding of the experience of DBS for patients andtheir spouses. There is a clear need for further research
to explore the exact nature of the transitions describedhere and how best patients and their spouses can be sup-
ported by healthcare professionals and others, before,
during and after DBS for PD. In assessing the impacts ofDBS, and other treatments in late stage PD, we should
consider how to capture the impacts on holistic concepts
such as control and normality . Studies that examine the out-
comes of DBS require longer term follow-up.

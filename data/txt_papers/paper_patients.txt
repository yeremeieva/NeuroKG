Objective: To review and synthesise qualitative
research studies that have explored patients ’experience
of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in advanced
Parkinson’ s disease (PD).
Design: Systematic review and meta-synthesis of
7 original papers, using metaethnography.
Setting: Studies conducted in Denmark, France and
Sweden.
Participants: 116 patients who had undergone DBS
and 9 spouses of patients.
Results: Prior to surgery, the experience of advancing
PD is one of considerable loss and a feeling of loss ofcontrol. There are significant hopes for what DBS canbring. Following surgery, a sense of euphoria isdescribed by many, although this does not persist andthere is a need for significant transitions following this.
We suggest that normality as a concept is core to the
experience of DBS and that a sense of control may bea key condition for normality. Experience of DBS forpatients and spouses, and of the transitions that theymust undertake, is influenced by their hopes of whatsurgery will enable them to achieve, or regain(ie, a new normality).
Conclusions: There is a need for further qualitative
research to understand the nature of these transitions
to inform how best patients and their spouses can besupported by healthcare professionals before, duringand after DBS. In assessing the outcomes of DBS and
other treatments in advanced PD, we should consider
how to capture holistic concepts such as normality andcontrol. Studies that examine the outcomes of DBSrequire longer term follow-up.
INTRODUCTION
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is widely used
to treat a range of Parkinson ’s disease (PD)
symptoms, typically in advanced PD,
although its ef ﬁcacy has been tested in
earlier stages.1DBS is effective in improving
many motor and some non-motor symptoms.Meta-analysis
2of six randomised controlledtrials (RCTs) of DBS demonstrates signi ﬁcant
improvements in motor disability, activities ofdaily living, medication use, mental health,
mood, behavioural problems and quality of
life (QoL). However, measures of communi-cation, dementia and executive functioning
favoured medication controls.
Despite the overall effectiveness of DBS,
observational studies and subgroup analysesof trial data demonstrate that not all patients
report improvements in QoL. Daniels et al
3
found that 43% of patients showed no
improvement at 6 months, and Soulas et al4
found that 37% showed no improvement or
a decline in QoL. For composite indices and
individual domains of global disease speci ﬁc
(eg, Parkinson ’s Disease Questionnaire
(PDQ)-39), and generic QoL measures,there are aggregate improvements in motor
signs, mobility, activities of daily living, stigmaand bodily discomfort, but no improvement
or decline in social support, emotional well-
being, cognition and communication.

Studies that have quanti ﬁed patients ’and
spouses ’perceived outcome at 3 months
postsurgery show positive ratings in only 47%and 33% of patients and spouses, respect-
ively.

disease onset and a history of impulse control disordersor compulsive medication use, although ﬁndings remain

Most research informing debates about the ef ﬁcacy
and use of DBS is quantitative, using measurement and
ratings scales. Although Maier et al9and Lewis et al8used
qualitative data collection methods (interviews) with
patients and spouses, their accounts were quanti ﬁed to
categorise participants into positive or negative outcomeassessments. The only commonly cited exception to thisis the study by Agid et al
11which used semistructured
psychological interviews to explore contrasts in perspec-tives on improvement post-DBS between clinicians,patients and spouses.
Qualitative research provides in-depth description,
understanding and explanation of patients ’experi-
ence of disease and treatment. The value of qualitative
evidence as an adjunct to RCTs is well recognised,
with examples of qualitative research being used tocontextualise and understand trial observations.
12
Paralleling meta-analysis for quantitative studies, quali-tative synthesis techniques have been developed toanalyse the ﬁndings of primary qualitative research, to
identify commonality and difference in ﬁndings, and
to arrive at higher order interpretations and explan-ation of the subjective experience of disease and treat-
ment from a patient perspective.
13We sought to
synthesise existing qualitative research that has exam-
ined patients’ experiences and perspectives related to
DBS. In doing so, we wished to examine whether thisresearch might provide some further insight into thevariable and often negative assessment of QoL given
by patients and spouses soon after DBS, despite the
apparent overall effectiveness of the procedure asmeasured in RCTs.
METHODS
Literature searchesSeveral strategies were employed to maximise the identi-
ﬁcation of relevant literature.
14 15These included
searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE
In Process and EMBASE via Ovid); CINAHL via EBSCO;
Social Sciences Citation Index and Conference
Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) via Web of Scienceand CENTRAL Trials Register; the Database of Abstracts
of Reviews of Effects; and Health T echnology
Assessment Database all via Cochrane Wiley).Conference abstracts were searched via CPCI (see
above) and British Library ’s ZETOC and authors of con-
ference abstracts contacted. Reference lists of included
papers were also searched.Selection criteria
English language papers published in peer-reviewed
journals, which reported using qualitative methodologyto explore patients ’or spouses ’experiences of DBS for
the treatment of advanced PD, were included. Weincluded research (one paper) reporting spouses ’per-
spectives as it can help to illuminate the experiences of
patients. The searches (see online supplementary
appendix 1 for an example) applied no date limits (ie,went back to inception for each database and were run
to the end of February 2015). Searches were part of a
wider project and covered the broader topic of patients ’
and spouses ’experience of living with PD. A focus on
DBS was required for this subproject, and relevantpapers were highlighted during the wider screeningprocess. Papers had to report results of qualitative ana-
lysis based on qualitative data collection methods (eg,
interviews, focus groups, observations). We includedmultiple papers from the same data set as long as they
reported the interpretation of different research ques-
tions. Editorials, narrative reviews and papers whichreported the experience of living with advanced PD but
not speci ﬁcally in relation to DBS were excluded.
ScreeningFollowing the removal of duplicates, the titles and
abstracts of identi ﬁed articles were screened, with exclu-
sion of those not meeting the above selection criteria.
Full-text versions of the remaining articles were reviewed
by two authors ( JM and LLJ) and the list of papers tobe included in the synthesis ﬁnalised via consensus dis-
cussion ( ﬁgure 1).
Quality assessment
There remains signi ﬁcant discussion in the literature
around quality appraisal of studies included in qualita-
tive syntheses. In particular, there are debates about the
meaning of quality and validity, how to incorporate the
ﬁndings of studies considered to be of lower quality, and
the uncritical use of quality checklists.
16 17We assessed
both the methodological reporting and robustness ofeach study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) Qualitative Checklist,
18and also their concep-
tual richness. Following this process, it was decided thatall of the identi ﬁed studies would be adopted in the
current synthesis. Two studies
11 19which we rated as low
quality in terms of reporting (eg, due to a lack of speci-ﬁed detail regarding recruitment of participants and
analytical approach) were rated highly in terms of their
conceptual richness.

Analysis
Metaethnography
20was used to identify, translate and
interpret shared concepts across the papers. The aim
of this approach is interpretive rather than aggrega-
tive, and thus is concordant with the paradigm that
underpins the majority of primary qualitative researchthat syntheses are based on.
21Metaethnography is the
longest established tool for synthesising qualitativeresearch,
13 22and has been used with smaller bodies
of literature and, despite its label and origins, with
non-ethnographic studies.23We broadly followed the
seven-step process proposed by Noblit and Hare20and
also used in a worked healthcare example by Brittenet al:21(1) getting started; (2) deciding what is rele-
vant to the initial interest; (3) reading the studies; (4)
determining how the studies are related; (5) translat-ing the studies into one another; (6) synthesising
translations and (7) expressing the synthesis. Each
paper, in the form of the extracted document ( ﬁrst
a n ds e c o n do r d e rc o n s t r u c t s ) ,w a sa n n o t a t e di nd e t a i l
by JM and LLJ and then core concepts and the inter-
pretation of these discussed at length to develop theline of argument presented in this paper. Core con-
cepts were mapped across the papers to ensure that
convergent and divergent cases were considered.However, it became clear that the studies were broadly
concordant and suitable for the reciprocal translation
that underpins the line of argument developed. Thepaper by Haahr et al
24was used as an index paper to
help facilitate the translation of studies into eachother as it was judged to be both conceptually rich
and well reported.

THE EXPERIENCE OF DBS AND PD
Only one paper26provides an explicit focus on life prior
to late stage PD and consideration of DBS. We will not
describe these data or other qualitative research focus-
ing on the experience of living with PD outside the
context of DBS in detail as it has been summarisedpreviously.
29
We provide a brief descriptive overview of the chron-
ology of experience of DBS, before a detailed descrip-tion of the core cross-cutting themes ( normality, loss, loss
of control, transitions, hopes ) in our interpretation of this
chronology ( table 2). These themes are highlighted in
bold in the text.
THE CHRONOLOGY
Pre-DBSThere is a need for higher dosage and more frequent
medication with advancing PD and life is increasingly
focused on the disease and treatment.
27Although
patients are able to maintain some control via medica-
tion, this time of gradual disease progression is described
as a period of considerable loss(ﬁgure 2 ).11 19 24– 27
Eventually, advanced PD is characterised by unpredict-
ability and a feeling of loss of control19 24– 28as the effect-
iveness of medication diminishes. Studies that presentdata on pre-DBS perspectives indicate that surgery is
viewed as a ‘last resort ’
11 19 25 26and that the choice to
undergo DBS is not much of a choice at all:
I was ready for an operation when the rigidity and the
dyskinesia superseded each other, so that I did not getany good time in between. (Patient
25)
There appear to be signi ﬁcant hopes19 24– 28for what
the surgery can bring, hopes that are in ﬂuenced by this
experience of lossand loss of control .
Post-DBS
Immediately postsurgery, a sense of euphoria11 19 25 27 28
is reported by many patients, resulting from the newfound (or regained) sense of freedom initially affordedby the procedure. Haahr et al
24indicate that this persists
for some, but collectively the evidence describes a needfor signi ﬁcant transitions to a new disease state and life,
following this initial euphoria. Although Haahr et al

BLATIVE brain sur gery was used as early as 1912
to treat PD.24,66When levodopa was introduced in
the 1960s, surgical interventions for PD decreased
dramatically .Within a few years, however ,the therapeutic
limitations of levodopa became apparent. Following the
administration of levodopa, PD continued to progress andtreatment-related complications including motor fluctua -
tions and dyskinesias became a major therapeutic chal-
lenge. More recently, neurosurgical interventions experi-enced a renaissance in the form of ablative procedures (forexample, pallidotomy).
43,44Nonetheless, as the use of pal-
lidotomy became more widespread, the shortcomings ofthis procedure were also realized. Adverse ef fects related to
bilateral pallidotomy included speech impairment, balance
and gait problems, visual field defects, and cognitive defi-cits.
1,21,68The search for safer and more ef fective sur gical
treatments, particularly for bilateral symptoms, fueled inter-
est in DBS.
Deep brain stimulation, which involves the application of
electrical stimuli, produces a functional lesion within a focalarea of the brain. T wo targets within the brain have been
stimulated to treat PD: the STN and the GPI. The first re -
ports of DBS for the management of PD were published
in the mid 1990s. Studies published since then have doc-
umented significant improvement in patient motor func-tioning
12,27,35,54and quality of life following STN DBS.10,31
Serious adverse events have also been reported including
infections,12,33,76 depression, mood changes, and psychosis
requiring intervention5,72,76,81 as well as equipment issues
such as lead fractures and dislodgements.12,54,81Authors of
studies on GPI stimulation have also reported improvedmotor function and time spent in the on state
12,21,29,38,42,47,55,82
as well as an enhanced perceived quality of life.67,78Serious
complications reported for bilateral GPI DBS include he-
matomas,12,47infections,63,81and equipment issues.12Oh and
colleagues52reported a hardware-related complication rate
(including lead fractures, migrations, erosions, and infec -
tions) of 25% for DBS, whereas authors of a long-term fol-
low-up study on STN DBS found 5% of patients with
dementia and/or hallucinations and 12% with apathy not
responsive to increased dopaminergic therapy.34Although
mortality rates have been low ( /H110211% in the 1st year post-
procedure), the rate of serious complications reveals the
need to systematically track, record, and compare adverseoutcomes according to the stimulation target.

Object. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat advanced Parkinson disease (PD) has been focused on one of two anatom-
ical targets: the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPI). Authors of more than 65 articles havereported on bilateral DBS outcomes. With one exception, these studies involved pre- and postintervention comparisons of
asingle target. Despite the paucity of data directly comparing STN and GPI DBS, many clinicians already consider the
STN to be the preferred target site. In this study the authors conducted a metaanalysis of the existing literature on patientoutcomes following DBS of the STN and the GPI.
Methods. This metaanalysis includes 31 STN and 14 GPI studies. Motor function improved significantly following
stimulation (54% in patients whose STN was targeted and 40% in those whose GPI was stimulated), with effect sizes (ESs)
of 2.59 and 2.04, respectively. After controlling for participant and study characteristics, patients who had undergone ei-ther STN or GPI DBS experienced comparable improved motor function following surgery (p = 0.094). The perfor-mance of activities of daily living improved significantly in patients with either target (40%). Medication requirementswere significantly reduced following stimulation of the STN (ES = 1.51) but did not change when the GPI was stimulat-ed (ES = 
/H110020.02).
Conclusions. In this analysis the authors highlight the need for uniform, detailed reporting of comprehensive motor and
nonmotor DBS outcomes at multiple time points and for a randomized trial of bilateral STN and GPI DBS.

ance. Data from an analysis of practice patterns confirm thatDBS is now the preferred surgical treatment for PD.
15Sig-
nificant questions regarding DBS remain, however, includ-ing which stimulation target site leads to better outcomes.It is not yet known whether certain patients or particularsymptoms respond better to stimulation of one target thananother. To our knowledge, in only one small study (10 pa-tients) have the authors randomly assigned patients to re-ceive bilateral GPI or STN stimulation and evaluated out-comes in a blinded fashion.
9In this study improvements
in motor function were documented regardless of the stim-ulation target. Levodopa intake decreased following DBS
in the STN-targeted group but remained unchanged in the
GPI-tar geted group. Given the small sample size, however,
a larger trial is needed to determine whether these findings
are robust.
In lieu of a large randomized trial, we conducted a sys-
tematic review of the work completed to date to quantifywhat has been learned about the outcomes of DBS for PD.In this metaanalysis we synthesized the results of publishedresearch on patient outcomes following bilateral DBS of theSTN and GPI targets in the brain.
Clinical Material and Methods
Literature Search and Article Selection
Several strategies were undertaken to identify all pub-
lished reports on outcomes of bilateral DBS of either theSTN or the GPI. We began with a MEDLINE search usingthe following MeSH terms: “Parkinson’s disease,” “deepbrain stimulation,” “subthalamic nucleus,” and “globus pal-lidum.” This search was supplemented by examining thebibliography published with a recent Food and Drug Ad-ministration report in which the literature on bilateral DBSof the STN and GPI was reviewed.
75In addition, we re -
viewed the references from articles identified in the afore-
mentioned searches to include any additional papers relatedto outcomes of DBS that may have been missed.
Inclusion criteria included the following factors: study
patients had idiopathic PD, therapeutic intervention in-volved bilateral DBS of either the STN or the GPI, report-ed outcomes included UPDRS motor function scores of f
medications at baseline and off medications/on stimulation
at follow up, and follow-up assessment occurred at least 3months post-DBS. Thus, studies documenting only non -
motor outcomes (for example, cognitive function) or surgi-
cal parameters (such as microelectrode recording) were notconsidered in our review . We also excluded publications
with motor function results that had already been publishedin another paper or in which DBS sur gery had been per -
formed for another indication (for instance, essential trem-
or), the electrode implantation site was neither the STN northe GPI or it was not bilateral, or the study patients had pre -
viously under gone intracranial sur gery for PD. Each article
considered was compared with a checklist of inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Only articles meeting the inclusion crite -
ria were retained for analysis.
A data extraction table was developed to code the ar-
ticles. This table included authors; journal title and yearof publication; country in which the study had been per-formed; percentage of male patients; average age of pa-tients; study design (single group pretest posttest, random-
ized trial, or quasiexperiment); intervention site (STN orGPI); number of patients undergoing each intervention; du-ration of follow-up periods (in months); average baselineUPDRS motor score off medication, standard deviation,and standard error or range; and average follow-up UPDRSscore off medication/on stimulation, standard deviation, andstandard error or range. If the study also included the ADLsubscore of the UPDRS we reported the baseline and fol-low-up scores and the conditions in which these scores hadbeen obtained (for example, off medication or on stimula-tion). Finally, if the study included the average medicationdosage in levodopa equivalents at baseline and follow up,
we recorded this information.
Dependent Variables
The primary outcome of interest in our metaanalysis is
the UPDRS17motor score (Part III) in the of f-medica-
tion/on-stimulation state. The motor subscale consists of
14 items, with score totals ranging from 0 to 104;3higher
scores are indicative of greater impairment. This subscaleenables assessments of facial expression, speech, tremors,rigidity, gait, posture, and bradykinesia and is scored basedon a trained assessor ’s observation of the patient. This mo-
tor outcome score is the most commonly reported in DBS
studies and reflects the ef fect of stimulation on patient mo -
tor function without medication. Regarding the more re-
cently published studies—that is, those from 2001 andthereafter—in which UPDRS motor scores were not report -
ed, we attempted to contact the authors to obtain this infor-mation, a successful strategy in only three cases.
30,39,74
Other frequently reported outcomes of interest include
the UPDRS ADL score (Part II) and medication require -
ments based on levodopa equivalents before and after DBS.The UPDRS ADL are self-reported by the patient and fo-cus on activities such as walking, writing, dressing, andspeaking. The ADL scores can range from 0 (no functionalimpairment) to 52 (maximal functional impairment). The
levodopa equivalent measure involves converting doses
of antiparkinsonian medications into comparable units oflevodopa. Most authors refer to the convention of Pahwa, etal.,
55who stated that 1 unit antiparkinsonian medication =
100 mg standard levodopa = 125 mg sustained-release levo-dopa = 100 ml liquid levodopa = 1 mg per golide = 10 mg
bromocriptine. These outcomes were examined only in the
papers that also included UPDRS motor scores. In one case,we were able to obtain UPDRS ADL scores directly fromthe authors even though they had not been reported in thepaper.
65Although we tried to reach some authors of earlier
reports to obtain additional information, either we were un -
able to reach these individuals or they no longer had the in -
formation we needed. 
Analysis of Data
Effect size expresses in terms of SD units the magnitude
of a treatment difference between two groups.25It allows for
comparisons across studies and is commonly used in meta-analyses. In our study, the primary outcome variables wereconverted to ESs, which were measured using a standard-ized mean difference between pre- (baseline) and post-DBS(follow up) for each separate outcome for the STN and GPIstudies. To calculate ES, the pre- and post-DBS means and

95712_05_JNS_pt_1,2  11/9/05  10:05 AM  Page 957some measure of variance (that is, SD, standard error, or
values for tests of significance) were needed.22For studies
with no variance information, SDs were estimated. The av-erage ratio of means to SDs was obtained from studies that
had both means and SDs. Then, SDs were estimated by di-viding the means for studies with no variance by the aver-
age ratio. To examine the impact of using estimated SDs,the overall ESs between including and excluding the stud -
ies with estimated SDs were compared. A test for the ho-mogeneity of outcome variables was performed to addresswhether all studies shared the same ES. In cases in which
results were not homogeneous, the overall mean ES for
each outcome was obtained from a random-ef fects model.
13
To figure statistical significance and to assist in determining
the clinical importance of ES, 95% CIs were calculated for
each individual study and all studies combined. Possible sources of heterogeneity were explored by com-
paring the mean ESs for subgroups of studies categorizedaccording to selected study level characteristics by using aformal random-effects metaregression analysis that includ-
ed these characteristics as covariates. Subgroup analyseswere conducted for the STN and GPI target groups sepa-
rately, and metaregressions were performed for the STNand GPI combined data. In the metaregression, the depen -
dent variable was the ES for each outcome of interest, andthe independent variables were the mean age of the sample,percentage of male participants, study location (European
compared with non-European), duration of follow up, study
publication year , and study sample size. T o evaluate the rel-
ative effectiveness of the anatomical target of stimulation
(STN compared with GPI) on the UPDRS motor score, this
target was included as a covariate in the model. All statisti-F. Weaver, et al.

Results
Description of Studies and Study Patients
We initially identified 65 studies through September
2003, with the first paper on bilateral DBS published in1995. (Note that some papers were counted more than once
if the authors reported findings separately for STN and GPIcases [for example, Krack, et al.
38]. In one study,56there
were separate samples of cases in two dif ferent geograph-
ic locations for both STN and GPI cases, resulting in four
sets of findings). Of this total, 20 studies were exclud-ed: five did not include UPDRS motor scores pre- and
post-DBS,
10,62–64,71six consisted of already reported data on
patients in another primary DBS study,2,35,41,49,73,80five had
either only pretest59,60or only posttest UPDRS motor
scores,4,20,69one had on-medication motor scores only,67one
included uni- and bilateral cases combined,32and two in-
volved only unilateral DBS on further inspection.23,83As a
result, our analysis included 45 studies: 23 with STN tar gets
only, six with GPI targets only, and eight with both STN andGPI targets, although results were reported separately for
each target.
The UPDRS motor scores at baseline and postsurgery
as well as the characteristics of each study included in themetaanalysis are detailed in Tables 1 (STN) and 2 (GPI).
The first report of bilateral DBS was published in 1995.
46
Most of the published studies had been conducted in six Eu-
ropean countries, with fewer studies originating in the US,
Canada, or elsewhere. Thirty papers and one published ab -
stract on bilateral STN published through September 2003
documented motor function outcomes in patients with PD.
Burchiel and colleagues9performed the only random-
ized trial in which STN and GPI targets were directly com-pared. For purposes of our metaanalysis, however, we re-
port the findings on the site of surgery separately. All otherreports were pre- and postintervention studies. The mean
sample size per study was 18 patients. The patients had a
mean age of 57.8 years at the time of surgery, and 66% of
those with an STN target were male. Because most studies(58%) included 6-month postsurgical outcomes, we exam-ined 6-month outcome data or those from the time period
closest to 6 months after sur gery. If a 6-month follow up had
not been conducted, we used data from the 3-month as -
sessment (16%). In some cases 8-month (7%) or 12-month
(9%) data only were available.
There were 13 published reports on bilateral GPI DBS
(Table 2). Again, most originated in European countries,and all were pre- and postintervention designs with samplesizes ranging from three to 38 patients (mean 10 patients).The mean age of patients was 55 years and 69% weremale. Only one GPI study has been published since 2001,
47
whereas one third (11 studies) of the STN reports were pub-
lished between 2002 and 2003.

ment in motor function following STN DBS, with 50% re-porting outcomes at 6 months postintervention. The meanimprovement in motor function according to the UPDRSmotor score was 54.3%, a decrease from a mean baselinemotor score of 51.9 to 22.8 at the follow up. Calculated ESs
and 95% CIs for each study and the overall mean ES arepresented in Fig. 1 
upper . Note that the study by Figueiras-
Méndez and colleagues18had only one patient and so was
not included in the ES calculation. Effect sizes of the indi-
vidual studies ranged from 0.9 to 5.58. The 95% confidence
limits of the ESs did not include 0 except for one study. TheF. Weaver, et al.

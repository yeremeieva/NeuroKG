BLATIVE brain sur gery was used as early as 1912
to treat PD.24,66When levodopa was introduced in
the 1960s, surgical interventions for PD decreased
dramatically .Within a few years, however ,the therapeutic
limitations of levodopa became apparent. Following the
administration of levodopa, PD continued to progress andtreatment-related complications including motor fluctua -
tions and dyskinesias became a major therapeutic chal-
lenge. More recently, neurosurgical interventions experi-enced a renaissance in the form of ablative procedures (forexample, pallidotomy).
43,44Nonetheless, as the use of pal-
lidotomy became more widespread, the shortcomings ofthis procedure were also realized. Adverse ef fects related to
bilateral pallidotomy included speech impairment, balance
and gait problems, visual field defects, and cognitive defi-cits.
1,21,68The search for safer and more ef fective sur gical
treatments, particularly for bilateral symptoms, fueled inter-
est in DBS.
Deep brain stimulation, which involves the application of
electrical stimuli, produces a functional lesion within a focalarea of the brain. T wo targets within the brain have been
stimulated to treat PD: the STN and the GPI. The first re -
ports of DBS for the management of PD were published
in the mid 1990s. Studies published since then have doc-
umented significant improvement in patient motor func-tioning
12,27,35,54and quality of life following STN DBS.10,31
Serious adverse events have also been reported including
infections,12,33,76 depression, mood changes, and psychosis
requiring intervention5,72,76,81 as well as equipment issues
such as lead fractures and dislodgements.12,54,81Authors of
studies on GPI stimulation have also reported improvedmotor function and time spent in the on state
12,21,29,38,42,47,55,82
as well as an enhanced perceived quality of life.67,78Serious
complications reported for bilateral GPI DBS include he-
matomas,12,47infections,63,81and equipment issues.12Oh and
colleagues52reported a hardware-related complication rate
(including lead fractures, migrations, erosions, and infec -
tions) of 25% for DBS, whereas authors of a long-term fol-
low-up study on STN DBS found 5% of patients with
dementia and/or hallucinations and 12% with apathy not
responsive to increased dopaminergic therapy.34Although
mortality rates have been low ( /H110211% in the 1st year post-
procedure), the rate of serious complications reveals the
need to systematically track, record, and compare adverseoutcomes according to the stimulation target.

Object. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat advanced Parkinson disease (PD) has been focused on one of two anatom-
ical targets: the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPI). Authors of more than 65 articles havereported on bilateral DBS outcomes. With one exception, these studies involved pre- and postintervention comparisons of
asingle target. Despite the paucity of data directly comparing STN and GPI DBS, many clinicians already consider the
STN to be the preferred target site. In this study the authors conducted a metaanalysis of the existing literature on patientoutcomes following DBS of the STN and the GPI.
Methods. This metaanalysis includes 31 STN and 14 GPI studies. Motor function improved significantly following
stimulation (54% in patients whose STN was targeted and 40% in those whose GPI was stimulated), with effect sizes (ESs)
of 2.59 and 2.04, respectively. After controlling for participant and study characteristics, patients who had undergone ei-ther STN or GPI DBS experienced comparable improved motor function following surgery (p = 0.094). The perfor-mance of activities of daily living improved significantly in patients with either target (40%). Medication requirementswere significantly reduced following stimulation of the STN (ES = 1.51) but did not change when the GPI was stimulat-ed (ES = 
/H110020.02).
Conclusions. In this analysis the authors highlight the need for uniform, detailed reporting of comprehensive motor and
nonmotor DBS outcomes at multiple time points and for a randomized trial of bilateral STN and GPI DBS.

ance. Data from an analysis of practice patterns confirm thatDBS is now the preferred surgical treatment for PD.
15Sig-
nificant questions regarding DBS remain, however, includ-ing which stimulation target site leads to better outcomes.It is not yet known whether certain patients or particularsymptoms respond better to stimulation of one target thananother. To our knowledge, in only one small study (10 pa-tients) have the authors randomly assigned patients to re-ceive bilateral GPI or STN stimulation and evaluated out-comes in a blinded fashion.
9In this study improvements
in motor function were documented regardless of the stim-ulation target. Levodopa intake decreased following DBS
in the STN-targeted group but remained unchanged in the
GPI-tar geted group. Given the small sample size, however,
a larger trial is needed to determine whether these findings
are robust.
In lieu of a large randomized trial, we conducted a sys-
tematic review of the work completed to date to quantifywhat has been learned about the outcomes of DBS for PD.In this metaanalysis we synthesized the results of publishedresearch on patient outcomes following bilateral DBS of theSTN and GPI targets in the brain.
Clinical Material and Methods
Literature Search and Article Selection
Several strategies were undertaken to identify all pub-
lished reports on outcomes of bilateral DBS of either theSTN or the GPI. We began with a MEDLINE search usingthe following MeSH terms: “Parkinson’s disease,” “deepbrain stimulation,” “subthalamic nucleus,” and “globus pal-lidum.” This search was supplemented by examining thebibliography published with a recent Food and Drug Ad-ministration report in which the literature on bilateral DBSof the STN and GPI was reviewed.
75In addition, we re -
viewed the references from articles identified in the afore-
mentioned searches to include any additional papers relatedto outcomes of DBS that may have been missed.
Inclusion criteria included the following factors: study
patients had idiopathic PD, therapeutic intervention in-volved bilateral DBS of either the STN or the GPI, report-ed outcomes included UPDRS motor function scores of f
medications at baseline and off medications/on stimulation
at follow up, and follow-up assessment occurred at least 3months post-DBS. Thus, studies documenting only non -
motor outcomes (for example, cognitive function) or surgi-
cal parameters (such as microelectrode recording) were notconsidered in our review . We also excluded publications
with motor function results that had already been publishedin another paper or in which DBS sur gery had been per -
formed for another indication (for instance, essential trem-
or), the electrode implantation site was neither the STN northe GPI or it was not bilateral, or the study patients had pre -
viously under gone intracranial sur gery for PD. Each article
considered was compared with a checklist of inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Only articles meeting the inclusion crite -
ria were retained for analysis.
A data extraction table was developed to code the ar-
ticles. This table included authors; journal title and yearof publication; country in which the study had been per-formed; percentage of male patients; average age of pa-tients; study design (single group pretest posttest, random-
ized trial, or quasiexperiment); intervention site (STN orGPI); number of patients undergoing each intervention; du-ration of follow-up periods (in months); average baselineUPDRS motor score off medication, standard deviation,and standard error or range; and average follow-up UPDRSscore off medication/on stimulation, standard deviation, andstandard error or range. If the study also included the ADLsubscore of the UPDRS we reported the baseline and fol-low-up scores and the conditions in which these scores hadbeen obtained (for example, off medication or on stimula-tion). Finally, if the study included the average medicationdosage in levodopa equivalents at baseline and follow up,
we recorded this information.
Dependent Variables
The primary outcome of interest in our metaanalysis is
the UPDRS17motor score (Part III) in the of f-medica-
tion/on-stimulation state. The motor subscale consists of
14 items, with score totals ranging from 0 to 104;3higher
scores are indicative of greater impairment. This subscaleenables assessments of facial expression, speech, tremors,rigidity, gait, posture, and bradykinesia and is scored basedon a trained assessor ’s observation of the patient. This mo-
tor outcome score is the most commonly reported in DBS
studies and reflects the ef fect of stimulation on patient mo -
tor function without medication. Regarding the more re-
cently published studies—that is, those from 2001 andthereafter—in which UPDRS motor scores were not report -
ed, we attempted to contact the authors to obtain this infor-mation, a successful strategy in only three cases.
30,39,74
Other frequently reported outcomes of interest include
the UPDRS ADL score (Part II) and medication require -
ments based on levodopa equivalents before and after DBS.The UPDRS ADL are self-reported by the patient and fo-cus on activities such as walking, writing, dressing, andspeaking. The ADL scores can range from 0 (no functionalimpairment) to 52 (maximal functional impairment). The
levodopa equivalent measure involves converting doses
of antiparkinsonian medications into comparable units oflevodopa. Most authors refer to the convention of Pahwa, etal.,
55who stated that 1 unit antiparkinsonian medication =
100 mg standard levodopa = 125 mg sustained-release levo-dopa = 100 ml liquid levodopa = 1 mg per golide = 10 mg
bromocriptine. These outcomes were examined only in the
papers that also included UPDRS motor scores. In one case,we were able to obtain UPDRS ADL scores directly fromthe authors even though they had not been reported in thepaper.
65Although we tried to reach some authors of earlier
reports to obtain additional information, either we were un -
able to reach these individuals or they no longer had the in -
formation we needed. 
Analysis of Data
Effect size expresses in terms of SD units the magnitude
of a treatment difference between two groups.25It allows for
comparisons across studies and is commonly used in meta-analyses. In our study, the primary outcome variables wereconverted to ESs, which were measured using a standard-ized mean difference between pre- (baseline) and post-DBS(follow up) for each separate outcome for the STN and GPIstudies. To calculate ES, the pre- and post-DBS means and

95712_05_JNS_pt_1,2  11/9/05  10:05 AM  Page 957some measure of variance (that is, SD, standard error, or
values for tests of significance) were needed.22For studies
with no variance information, SDs were estimated. The av-erage ratio of means to SDs was obtained from studies that
had both means and SDs. Then, SDs were estimated by di-viding the means for studies with no variance by the aver-
age ratio. To examine the impact of using estimated SDs,the overall ESs between including and excluding the stud -
ies with estimated SDs were compared. A test for the ho-mogeneity of outcome variables was performed to addresswhether all studies shared the same ES. In cases in which
results were not homogeneous, the overall mean ES for
each outcome was obtained from a random-ef fects model.
13
To figure statistical significance and to assist in determining
the clinical importance of ES, 95% CIs were calculated for
each individual study and all studies combined. Possible sources of heterogeneity were explored by com-
paring the mean ESs for subgroups of studies categorizedaccording to selected study level characteristics by using aformal random-effects metaregression analysis that includ-
ed these characteristics as covariates. Subgroup analyseswere conducted for the STN and GPI target groups sepa-
rately, and metaregressions were performed for the STNand GPI combined data. In the metaregression, the depen -
dent variable was the ES for each outcome of interest, andthe independent variables were the mean age of the sample,percentage of male participants, study location (European
compared with non-European), duration of follow up, study
publication year , and study sample size. T o evaluate the rel-
ative effectiveness of the anatomical target of stimulation
(STN compared with GPI) on the UPDRS motor score, this
target was included as a covariate in the model. All statisti-F. Weaver, et al.

Results
Description of Studies and Study Patients
We initially identified 65 studies through September
2003, with the first paper on bilateral DBS published in1995. (Note that some papers were counted more than once
if the authors reported findings separately for STN and GPIcases [for example, Krack, et al.
38]. In one study,56there
were separate samples of cases in two dif ferent geograph-
ic locations for both STN and GPI cases, resulting in four
sets of findings). Of this total, 20 studies were exclud-ed: five did not include UPDRS motor scores pre- and
post-DBS,
10,62–64,71six consisted of already reported data on
patients in another primary DBS study,2,35,41,49,73,80five had
either only pretest59,60or only posttest UPDRS motor
scores,4,20,69one had on-medication motor scores only,67one
included uni- and bilateral cases combined,32and two in-
volved only unilateral DBS on further inspection.23,83As a
result, our analysis included 45 studies: 23 with STN tar gets
only, six with GPI targets only, and eight with both STN andGPI targets, although results were reported separately for
each target.
The UPDRS motor scores at baseline and postsurgery
as well as the characteristics of each study included in themetaanalysis are detailed in Tables 1 (STN) and 2 (GPI).
The first report of bilateral DBS was published in 1995.
46
Most of the published studies had been conducted in six Eu-
ropean countries, with fewer studies originating in the US,
Canada, or elsewhere. Thirty papers and one published ab -
stract on bilateral STN published through September 2003
documented motor function outcomes in patients with PD.
Burchiel and colleagues9performed the only random-
ized trial in which STN and GPI targets were directly com-pared. For purposes of our metaanalysis, however, we re-
port the findings on the site of surgery separately. All otherreports were pre- and postintervention studies. The mean
sample size per study was 18 patients. The patients had a
mean age of 57.8 years at the time of surgery, and 66% of
those with an STN target were male. Because most studies(58%) included 6-month postsurgical outcomes, we exam-ined 6-month outcome data or those from the time period
closest to 6 months after sur gery. If a 6-month follow up had
not been conducted, we used data from the 3-month as -
sessment (16%). In some cases 8-month (7%) or 12-month
(9%) data only were available.
There were 13 published reports on bilateral GPI DBS
(Table 2). Again, most originated in European countries,and all were pre- and postintervention designs with samplesizes ranging from three to 38 patients (mean 10 patients).The mean age of patients was 55 years and 69% weremale. Only one GPI study has been published since 2001,
47
whereas one third (11 studies) of the STN reports were pub-
lished between 2002 and 2003.

38in all figures.12_05_JNS_pt_1,2  11/9/05  10:05 AM  Page 960overall mean ES calculated from the random-effects mod-
el was 2.59 (95% CI 2.23–2.91), which was significantlygreater than 0 (p 
/H110210.001). The UPDRS motor scores
decreased significantly after STN DBS, signifying im-proved motor function. These studies were not homogene-ous in terms of ES (Q = 92.8, df = 29, p 
/H110210.001). The
results of subgroup analyses to examine possible sources ofheterogeneity showed that there was no significant differ-ence in the ESs when comparing studies conducted in Eu-rope and those in other countries (2.53 compared with 2.77,respectively), studies with a mean patient age of 55 years oryounger and those with a mean patient age greater than 55years (2.62 compared with 2.6, respectively), studies with
sample sizes of 10 or fewer patients and those with sample
sizes greater than 10 patients (2.44 compared with 2.65, re -
spectively), and studies published between 2001 and 2003
and those published in 2000 or earlier (2.53 compared with2.74, respectively). The calculated ESs for studies that didnot include SDs and those that did were 2.9 and 2.48, re-spectively (the probability value was not significant).
Similarly, Fig. 1 
lower provides motor function data for
individuals who underwent bilateral GPI stimulation. Six-
month follow-up outcomes were reported for most cases.
These reports documented a mean UPDRS motor score of52.2 at baseline and a mean score of 32.5 on follow up, as
well as a 40% improvement in motor function in the on-stimulation/of f-medication state following GPI DBS (T able
2). Individual ESs ranged from 0.68 to 4.58. There werethree studies in which the 95% confidence limits included0. The overall mean ES from the random-effects model was
2.04 (95% CI 1.5–2.58), which indicated that the UPDRS
motor scores significantly decreased following GPI DBS.
Again, there was significant heterogeneity between the ESs(Q = 32.57, df = 13, p 
/H110210.0021). Results of subgroup anal -
yses for GPI DBS revealed that the dif ferences in the ESs
between subgroups were more pronounced than the dif-
ferences in the ESs for STN DBS subgroups. Nonetheless,
there was no significant difference in the ESs when compar-
ing the studies conducted in Europe and those in other coun -
tries (2.07 compared with 1.77, respectively), studies with
a mean patient age of 55 years or younger and those witha mean patient age of 55 years (2.48 compared with 1.57,
respectively), studies with sample sizes of 10 or fewer pa -
tients and those with samples greater than 10 patients (1.81compared with 2.57, respectively), and studies published
between 2001 and 2003 and those published in 2000 or ear -
lier (1.44 compared with 2.42, respectively). The calculated
ESs for reports that included no SD and those with SDs
were not statistically significant (2.2 compared with 2.01,respectively; probability level not significant).
Patient (age and sex) and study characteristics (study
location, duration of study follow up, publication year ofstudy, and sample size) were not significantly associated
with the ES for the UPDRS motor score in the metaregres-sion analysis. The surgical target (STN or GPI) was notstatistically significant (p = 0.361) after adjusting for theaforementioned dichotomous independent variables (ex-
cluding sex because five studies were missing this informa -
tion). When the analysis was repeated including studies
with sex information (37 studies) and adjusting for all pa-tient and study characteristics, the surgical target was notsignificant (p = 0.743), indicating that patients in whom ei-
ther target was used had comparable improvement in motorfunction following DBS. When STN and GPI sites were
compared without adjusting for any covariates, greater im-provement was associated with the STN than the GPI, butthis result was not statistically significant (p = 0.09).
Because of the progressive nature of PD, we were also in-
terested in examining the long-term effects of DBS. Un-fortunately, only 11 STN and three GPI studies included
12-month or longer outcomes; therefore, we examined all
studies with 12-month outcomes and those with 6-month
outcomes if the 12-month results were not available. This
approach resulted in 26 STN studies with a mean motor
function improvement of 56.5% and 11 GPI studies with a
mean functional improvement of 39.8%.
3The overall ESs
(95% CIs) for these studies of STN and GPI targets were
2.63 (2.29–2.97) and 2.21 (1.47–2.95), respectively. Results
of a metaregression analysis adjusting for patient and study
characteristics (that is, patient age and sex, study origin,
year of study, and sample size) revealed that the overall ESs
between STN and GPI surgical sites were not statistically
different, indicating that stimulation of either of these sites
was equally effective in improving motor function. As in
the earlier analyses, the ESs between studies were not ho-mogeneous for either STN or GPI reports (p 
/H110210.001 for
each).
Activities of Daily Living According to the UPDRS
Authors of 50% of the STN DBS studies reported
UPDRS ADL scores before and after stimulation in the off-medication state, as did 57% of the authors of the GPI DBSstudies. Ef fect sizes and their 95% CIs for the individual
studies are presented in Fig. 2. In all studies, the ESs for
STN DBS were positive and none of the 95% confidencelimits included 0. The overall mean ES from the random-ef-
fects model was 1.81 (95% CI 1.62–2), indicating signifi-
cant improvement in ADL following STN DBS. Similarly,there was only one negative ES for GPI DBS. The overall
mean ES from the random-effects model of GPI studies was
1.48 (95% CI 1.14–1.81), indicating significantly improvedADL functioning after DBS. There was significant hetero-
geneity for both STN and GPI studies (p 
/H110210.001 for each).
Results of the subgroup analyses indicated that the ES forstudies published in 2000 or earlier was greater than the ES
for studies published between 2001 and 2003 (4.03 com-
pared with 1.82, respectively, for STN and 3.89 comparedwith 1.1, respectively, for GPI). The ES for both STN andGPI studies with a mean patient age of 55 years or youngerwas greater than that for studies with a mean patient age
greater than 55 years. In the metaregression analysis (ex-
cluding studies with missing sex information), the ESs forthe ADL score were significantly smaller for studies withsample sizes of 10 or fewer patients, those published morerecently (2001–2003), and those with a mean patient age
greater than 55 years; the remaining independent variables
that characterize these studies were not significantly asso -
ciated with ADL. The site of sur gery did not dif ferentially
affect improvement in ADL functioning in the off-medica-
tion state, with ADL scores improving by a mean of 40%
over baseline for both surgical sites. The mean ADL scores
in the off-medication state at baseline and follow up were27.9 and 14.8 for STN DBS studies and 28 and 17.2, re -
spectively , for GPI DBS studies.
Authors of several studies (11 STN and five GPI) also

was on medication at baseline and follow up. Data from theSTN studies revealed a decrease from a mean score of 11.3
at baseline to 8.5 at the follow up. Nonetheless, the ES
was small (0.61) and the 95% confidence limits for morethan half of the studies included 0, indicating that improve-
ment in ADL functioning was not statistically significant. A
change in the mean ADL scores from 19.4 to 12.4 in the on-medication/on-stimulation state was noted in the GPI stud-
ies. These studies had a mean ES equal to 1.6 and only oneof the five studies had a confidence limit that included 0.

an overall mean ES of 1.51 (95% CI 1.15–1.87), indicatinga significant reduction in medication use following DBS.
On average, authors of these studies reported a 52% reduc-
tion in daily medication dosage. Effect sizes for GPI DBSranged from 
/H110020.6 to 0.4, and the mean ES was /H110020.02 (95%
CI /H110020.29–0.26). The ES was positive in four studies (50%)and all 95% confidence limits included 0, which indicated
that in none of the studies was medication use significantlyreduced following GPI DBS. There was significant hetero -
geneity of ESs for STN DBS (p 
/H110210.001) but not for GPI
DBS (p = 0.948).
Discussion

al STN and GPI DBS for PD indicated that motor function

ly after DBS, regardless of the stimulation target. The ben-eficial effect was greater, although not statistically signif-icantly so, in STN compared with GPI cases. Medicationdosages were reduced by 50% following STN DBS but didnot change in patients who had undergone GPI DBS. Ac-tivities of daily living functioning improved equally in bothgroups in the off-medication state; GPI DBS (but not STNDBS) also led to improvement in ADL in the on-medicationstate.
The results presented in the current metaanalysis should
be interpreted cautiously. Only one study was a randomized
trial and numerous factors limited our ability directly to
compare outcomes according to the anatomical target ofstimulation. Among these factors are differences in sample
sizes, enrollment criteria, and selection criteria for DBS at
one site as opposed to the other (for example, physician and
patient preferences or predominant symptom). Physician
experience
3and patient expectations58may have a signif-
icant impact on outcomes and cannot be assessed in theexisting literature. Other factors including targeting tech-
niques, final location of implanted electrodes, and the extentto which stimulation is fine-tuned after DBS can also affectoutcomes. This information is neither reported nor easilysynthesized when available. Generalization of our findings
to the general PD population may be limited, given that themean age of patients reported in the literature (~ 56 years)
and the age at onset of the disease (62.4 years) dif fer from
the average age of the general PD population.
70Neverthe -
less, the findings are quite robust; when we excluded cer-tain studies based on sample size, year of study publication,study origin, or duration of follow up, the results remainedrelatively stable.
A differential effect of the stimulation target was found
when medication requirements were examined. Medica-
tion requirements decreased in all studies following STN
DBS but not following bilateral GPI DBS. W e do not know
whether STN DBS and GPI DBS have differential effects
on medication requirements or whether the difference is
an artifact resulting from assumptions about medicationneeds following stimulation at these sites. In general, STNDBS allows reduced medication without adversely affect-
ing motor function. Furthermore, STN DBS may exacer-
bate dyskinesias, and reduction of dyskinesias following
this therapy is dependent on a reduction in PD medications.
In contrast, GPI DBS may have a direct antidyskinetic ef -
fect that is not dependent on a reduction in medications,
and many providers do not attempt to reduce medication in
this group.
79Whether medications can be reduced follow-
ing GPI stimulation without negative consequences has notbeen studied, nor have differences in medication require-
ments after STN and GPI DBS been compared in a prospec -
tive, blinded fashion.
Mounting evidence suggests that medication withdraw-
al after surgery for PD may not be desirable in all patients.
The withdrawal of medication after surgery may exacerbate
nonmotor symptoms, especially neuropsychological dys-
function such as af fective and personality disorders.
28,34,36,81
In some patients, adverse ef fects of STN DBS on nonmotor
symptoms can negate improvement in motor symptoms.
Reinstitution of medical therapy can correct these problemsin some patients.
16,34In light of these observations, data indi-
cating better ADL and disability outcomes in the on-med-ication state in patients undergoing GPI DBS, compared
with STN DBS, are interesting. Our data revealed that pa-tients undergoing GPI and STN DBS had improvement ofADLs in the off-medication state, but only patients who had
undergone GPI DBS showed improvement in ADLs while
in the on-medication state as well. Burchiel and colleagues
9
reported that medical therapy might have a synergistic ef-
fect with GPI but not with STN DBS. The Deep-BrainStimulation for Parkinson’s Disease Study Group
12reported
disability scores (rated separately by physicians and pa-tients) before and after DBS for treatment of PD. The de-gree of improvement in disability was greater in patients
who had undergone GPI DBS than in those who had under-
gone STN DBS (the degree of significance was not indicat-ed). The better ADL and disability scores in patients whounderwent GPI DBS support the presence of a synergisticeffect between medical therapy and GPI DBS. Perhaps this
result occurs through better control of nonmotor symptomsby continued medication therapy in the patients treated us-
ing GPI DBS.
In this metaanalysis we used the UPDRS motor score as
its primary measure for a comparison between STN DBS
and GPI DBS because this measure is most commonly re-
ported in the published literature pertaining to the surgicaltreatment of PD. Objective motor function as scored using
the UPDRS is relatively easy for physicians to assess butmay not be the outcome of greatest functional significanceto patients. Other patient and physician-related outcomesthat can influence the superiority of DBS at one site com-pared with another include time in the on state withoutdyskinesias, functional disability and ADLs, complicationsof therapy , mood, mentation, and complexity of patient
care. Whether the relative superiority of STN DBS in im-proving functional (UPDRS) motor scores is sufficient inand of itself to place STN DBS at the forefront of surgicaltherapy for PD remains unsettled. The better UPDRS mo-
tor scores achieved through STN DBS must be balanced
by the postprocedural potential for increased cognitive dys-
function
26and greater frequency of mood changes com -
pared with those in patients who undergo GPI DBS.53,79
Complications and adverse events of DBS are also im-
portant to consider in a comparison of STN and GPI stimu -
lation but were not examined in this metaanalysis. It was not
possible to synthesize these findings across studies because
not all authors reported adverse events, definitions of any
reported adverse events were not uniform across studies,and it was not always possible to distinguish among stim-ulation effects (modifiable), transient effects, and adverse
events that resulted in permanent changes. 
Limitations of metaanalyses pertaining to surgery for PD
have been described by Bakay.
3Chief among these limita-
tions is the adverse impact of including poor -quality, non-
uniform data in the metaanalysis. Our review of the exist-ing literature reveals significant variability in the quality ofpublished reports. We have tried to minimize the inherent
limitations of metaanalyses through careful selection and
evaluation of published reports detailing outcomes of STN
and GPI DBS. Only those reports that met our strict inclu -
sion criteria were incorporated into the analysis. Some re -
ports may have included patients whose data were also de-
tailed in other publications, but this duplication was notalways clear. We therefore attempted to identify and use
data only from the most recent, most relevant, and/or mostF. Weaver, et al.
964 J. Neurosurg. / Volume 103 / December, 200512_05_JNS_pt_1,2  11/9/05  10:05 AM  Page 964complete publication. Additionally, in several studies the
sample size changed between the baseline and follow-upassessments and it was not always clear on what sample theanalysis had been conducted. Although most authors only
examined outcomes at a single time point (for example, 6
months postintervention), a few reported outcomes at mul-
tiple points (for example, 1, 3, and 12 months post-DBS).
We selected the time closest to 6 months postsurgery forall studies to have a more uniform assessment. In fact, 12-
month data in some studies showed that the effect of DBSon motor function is greater than that found in assessmentscloser to the time of surgery (perhaps reflecting fine-tuning
of medications and stimulation over time). Furthermore, we
included three studies in which the authors did not spe-cifically report when follow up had been conducted. Whenanalyses were redone limiting studies to those with 6- or,preferably, 12-month outcomes, the results did not change.
Finally, although we excluded studies that combined unilat-eral and bilateral cases if the data were not presented sepa-
rately, we did include one paper in which one patient had re-
ceived a unilateral implant and the rest of the sample hadreceived bilateral implants.
14We could not control some
factors that directly affect surgical outcomes, such as physi-
cian experience, lack of blinded assessments, targeting tech-niques, location of implanted electrodes, and postoperativestimulation management.
Subthalamic nucleus DBS has gained significant popu-
larity and, based on improvement in motor function and de -
creased medication requirements, the STN is considered thepreferred site of bilateral stimulation by most PD specialtycenters. Data from our analysis indicates that motor func -
tion improves equally in the GPI-targeted cases, while med-ication needs do not change. Additional important questionsabout DBS tar get sites remain unanswered. What are the
effects of the stimulation target site on other outcomes suchas cognitive and psychosocial functioning, speech, balance,gait, and quality of life? Do patients value improvement insome symptoms more than others? Are there dif ferential
costs and is cost-ef fectiveness dependent on the target site?
Are there differential surgical risks and management com-
plexities? These issues are critically important to the field:DBS is an expensive therapy , its use requires a long-term
commitment on the part of patients as well as physicians,and there are many potential candidates for the procedure.
Conclusions
A review of the published literature and the results of our
metaanalysis reveal the need for a large randomized con-trolled trial of STN and GPI DBS to evaluate the relative ef-fectiveness of stimulation targets based on multiple patientoutcomes at multiple time points. Within the context of alarge randomized trial, patient factors such as age, sex, andrace and disease factors such as the predominant symptom(for example, tremor, dyskinesia, or postural instability) thatmay differentially affect outcomes of DBS can be distin-guished. Long-term effects (that is, those present 
/H110221 year
postsurgery) of DBS on patient functioning should also beconsidered. In all likelihood, certain types of patients and/orparticular disease symptoms may respond better to stimula-tion at one target than another, but we cannot determine thedifference based on the existing literature. Therapy-specificfactors that could influence target selection for DBS might
also be identified in a large-scale trial, for instance, inci-dence and severity of surgical complications, stimulation-related side effects, and management complexity. Given thepromise of DBS for long-term management of advancedPD, clinicians and patients should make treatment decisionsbased on evidence from well-designed trials that minimizebias and provide valid findings to inform clinical practice.

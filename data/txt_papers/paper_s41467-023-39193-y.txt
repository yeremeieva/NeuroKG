Previous studies on the natural history of long-COVID have been few and
selective. Without comparison groups, disease progression cannot be differ-
entiated from symptoms originating f rom other causes. The Long-COVID in
Scotland Study (Long-CISS) is a Scotlan d-wide, general population cohort of
adults who had laboratory-con ﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection matched to PCR-
negative adults. Serial, self-completed , online questionnaires collected infor-
mation on pre-existing health conditions and current health six, 12 and 18months after index test. Of those with previous symptoma tic infection, 35%
reported persistent incomplete/n o recovery, 12% improvement and 12%
deterioration. At six and 12 months, one or more symptom was reported by71.5% and 70.7% respectively of those previously infected, compared with53.5% and 56.5% of those never infecte d. Altered taste, smell and confusion
improved over time compared to the nev er infected group and adjusted for
confounders. Conversely, late onset dry and productive cough, and hearingproblems were more likely following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Understanding the scale and natural history of long-COVID is essential
to planning health and social care. The majority of studies report theprevalence of long-COVID at a single timepoint post-infection
1–7,w i t h
some adjusting for pre-existing symptoms8,9. Less is known about
changes in long-COVID over time. Studies with serial outcome mea-
surements have been restricted to selected groups (e.g. hospitalised
patients10–13, older patients14, or veterans with break-through
infections15)o rs p e c i ﬁc (e.g. mental health) outcomes16, or have
lacked a comparison group making it dif ﬁcult to distinguish persistent
or late-onset symptoms of long-COVID from symptoms that wouldhave occurred anyway in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection
11–13,17,18.
Hospital cohorts have variously reported no change10,11,13,
improvement10,11, and deterioration over time10,14. In one cohort of 807
people, there was no change in the proportion reporting full recoverybetween 5 months and 1 year post discharge13. A study of 61 subjects
reported no change in quality of life, but improvement in 6-minwalking test distance
11. A meta-analysis of seven cohort studies inclu-
ded 2883 people with repeat measures, in whom the prevalence ofdepression declined over follow-up and was not signi ﬁcantly different
to the comparison group beyond 2 months
16.
Some studies have highlighted the possibility of late-onset
sequelae. In an ambidirectional cohort study, conducted on 1276patients, the proportion reporting at least one symptom decreasedfrom 68% at 6-month follow-up to 49% at 12 months
10. However, both
breathlessness (26% to 30%) and anxiety/depression (23% to 26%)increased over time. Three- to six-month follow-up of veterans withbreak-through SARS-CoV-2 infections (infections despite vaccination)revealed increased risk of new (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 –1.20) as well asReceived: 24 January 2023

cohort study using linked electronic health records, 37% of people hadat least one of nine long-COVID features 3 –6 months after SARS-CoV-2
infection
19. Of these, 40% had not had these features in the ﬁrst
3 months of follow-up. A hospital cohort of 1438 patients, 60 years of
age or older, reported increased risk of progressive and late onsetcognitive decline at 12-months follow-up among severe cases

Therefore, while long-COVID may be a stable condition in some,
existing evidence suggests that others may experience recovery,relapse, or progression. We use serial questionnaire data from thelong-COVID in Scotland Study (Long-CISS)
20to investigate the natural
history of long-COVID in an unselec ted, general population cohort
with laboratory-con ﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with
symptoms in an age-, sex-, and socioeconomically-matched group ofpeople who have never been infected.Results
Of the 4,049,590 questionnaires sent out, 345,673 (9%) were com-pleted by 288,173 unique individuals, of whom 257,341 (89%) con-sented to record linkage, required to obtain their test result (Fig. 1).
Following linkage, 53,530 were excluded because they reported a
previous positive test that was not recorded on the database, 5687because they had asymptomatic infections, and 37,343 because theywere recruited beyond 6 months follow-up. Of the remaining160,781 individuals, 80,332 (50%) had previous symptomatic,laboratory-con ﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 80,449 (50%) had
never had a positive test for SARS-CoV2 infection. Of the 80,332people who had previous symptomatic infections, 12,947 have so farcompleted questionnaires at both 6- and 12-month follow-up and4196 have completed questionnaires at both 6- and 18-month follow-up. The corresponding ﬁgures for the 80,449 individuals never
infected were 11,026 and 1711, respectively. The sample size was
23,973 (12,947 symptomatic infected and 11,026 never infected) forthe primary analysis of 6- and 12-month follow-up. The index test

November 2021.
Changes in recovery status
Six months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6407 (49.5%) peoplereported being fully recovered, 5649 (43.6%) partially and 891 (6.9%)not recovered. At 12-month follow-up, the ﬁgures were 6575 (50.8%),
5412 (41.8%) and 960 (7.4%), respectively ( χ
2trend, p= 0.323). Forty-
one percent of people reported full recovery at both 6- and 12-monthfollow-up, 35% reported persistent incomplete/no recovery, 12%reported improvement and 12% deterioration (Table 1). Between 6 and
18 months, the ﬁgures were 36%, 36%, 14% and 15%, respectively.
Of those who felt partially recovered at 6 months, 1179/5649 (21%)
had improved by 12 months and 421/1934 (22%) by 18 months and, ofthe 891 people not recovered at 6 months, 404 (45%) had some degreeof improvement by 12 months, and 28 (3%) had fully recovered. Ofthose who felt partially recovered at 6 months, 458/5649 (8%) reporteddeterioration at 12 months and 189/1934 (10%) at 18 months. In addi-tion, of 6407 who reported being fully recovered at 6 months, 1039(16%) reported deterioration by 12 months.
Depression prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and socioeconomic
deprivation were more common among people who reported dete-
rioration in recovery status between 6 and 12 months (Table 2). Similar
patterns were observed comparing 6- and 18-month follow-up (Sup-plementary Table 1). Among those not fully recovered at 6 months,improvement at 12 months was less likely among older people andthose with depression prior to COVID-19 and more likely among themost af ﬂuent, after adjusting for potential confounders (Table 3;
unadjusted odds ratios in Supplementary Table 2). Among those whoreported full or partial recovery at 6 months, deterioration at12 months was less likely among older people and the most af ﬂuent
and more likely among people with prior depression (Table 3). The
associations were not statistically signi ﬁcant comparing 6- and 18-
month follow-up (Supplementary Table 3; unadjusted odds ratios in
Supplementary Table 4).
Changes in symptoms
The percentage who reported at least one of the 26 symptoms did not
change between 6- and 12-month (72% versus 71%, respectively), and 6-and 18-month (73% versus 74%, respectively) follow-up, among people
with previous symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection but increased sig-niﬁcantly among those never infected (54% versus 57%, and 52% versus
55%, respectively; Table 4). Previously symptomatic participants had a
higher prevalence of new and persistent symptoms than those never
infected, at both 12- and 18-month follow-up compared with 6-monthfollow-up (Supplementary Fig. 2).
The prevalence of confusion and altered taste and smell
decreased signi ﬁcantly between 6 and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2
infection contrasting with no signi ﬁcant change in confusion and
altered smell, and an increase in altered taste, among those neverinfected (Table 4). The reductions were signi ﬁcant compared to those
never infected after adjusting for potential confounders (Table 5;
unadjusted odds ratios in Supplementary Table 5).
Reduced prevalence of altered taste/smell and confusion was
speci ﬁc to those who reported an improvement in their recovery sta-
tus following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Table 6). Theprevalence of confusion 6 months following symptomatic SARS-CoV-2infection was signi ﬁcantly higher among those with a history of
depression or anxiety than those without (1090/5839 (18.7%) versus780/7108 (11.0%); p< 0.001) and improvement in confusion between
6- and 12-months was less likely among people with pre-existingdepression or anxiety (Table 5).
People with previous symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection repor-
ted signi ﬁcant increases in the prevalence of both dry and productive
cough between 6- and 12-month follow-up (Table 4). However, these
symptoms were also reported more frequently over time in the never
infected group. The increased prevalence of both dry and productivecough remained signi ﬁcantly higher among those previously infected
than those never infected, after adjusting for confounders (Table 5).
The factors associated with increased prevalence of dry cough wereyounger age, more pre-existing long-term conditions, and speci ﬁcally
pre-existing depression/anxiety (secondary effect estimates; Table 5).
Increased prevalence of productive cough was associated with malesex and pre-existing respiratory disease (secondary effect estimates;Table 5). Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, late onset cough was speci ﬁc
to those who reported deterioration in their recovery status (Supple-
mentary Table 6).
Increases in the prevalence of hearing problems between 6- and
12-month follow-up were reported by both those with previoussymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and those never infected (Table 4).
After adjustment for confounders, the increased prevalence of hearingproblems was signi ﬁcantly higher among those previously infected
than those never infected (Table 5). Other factors associated with late
onset hearing problems were socioeconomic deprivation, SARS-CoV-2infection severity, and more pre-existing long-term conditions andspeci ﬁcally depression/anxiety (secondary effect estimates; Table 5).
Between 6- and 18-months follow-up, increased prevalence of dry
cough, productive cough and hearing problems were all signi ﬁcant
compared to those never infected after adjusting for potential con-founders (Supplementary Table 7; unadjusted odds ratios in Supple-mentary Table 8).
Changes in quality of life
Following symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, median EQ-5D VASscore decreased slightly from 75 (IQR 55 –86) at 6 months to 74 (IQR
53–85) at 12 months ( p< 0.001). However, it also fell among those
never infected, from 80 (IQR 64 –90) to 77 (IQR 61 –90) (p<0 . 0 0 1 ) .I n
the fully adjusted Poisson regression model, symptomatic infectionwas associated with a larger fall in EQ-5D VAS score compared with
those never infected (IRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.98 –0.98).

Beyond 6 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was no sig-niﬁcant overall change in either self-reported recovery status or the
percentage of people reporting at least one symptom known to beassociated with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection
20.H o w e v e r ,1 2 %o f
people reported improvements in their recovery status, and 12%reported deterioration. These different trajectories were driven bydifferent symptoms. In some people, altered taste, smell and confu-sion ( ‘brain fog ’) resolved over time whereas others reported late onset
dry or productive cough and hearing problems. These changes werenot explained by underlying trends or confounding. Our ﬁndings
demonstrate the importance of exploring individual symptoms rather
than only grouping them together as a composite outcome.
Our analyses of serial outcomes corroborated our previous ﬁnd-
ing of late onset cough
20,a n di d e n t i ﬁed a new ﬁnding of late onset
hearing problems. Respiratory impairment following COVID-19 is well-recognised. A meta-analysis of 15 studies that followed-up 3066patients hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 infection reported that 56% hadresidual lung CT abnormalities and 44% had abnormal lung functiontests: 35% impaired diffusion, 16% restrictive impairment and 8%obstructive impairment
21. Systematic reviews had demonstrated that
sudden sensorineural hearing loss occurring during acute SARS-CoV-2
infection can persist22. Proposed mechanisms include a direct effect of
viral invasion via ACE2 receptors located in the ear23, indirect effects
via hypoxia, immune-mediated damage or coagulative disorders24,a n d
ototoxic medications used to treat COVID-1922. The prevalence of
several common long-COVID symptoms, for example fatigue, muscleaches/weakness, headache, and anxiety/depression, remained stablewithin previously infected individuals over time. This has implicationsfor individuals living with long-COVID and for clinical practice.
Socioeconomic deprivation and depression are known to be
associated with development of long-COVID
4,19,20.O u r ﬁndings elabo-
rate by showing both to also be associated with reduced risk of
improvement over time and increased risk of deterioration. Biological
mechanisms may partly explain these observations. The relationshipbetween depression and in ﬂammation is bidirectional
25–27.N o v e l
immune therapeutic targets are being investigated for the treatment ofdepression
28, and there is a well-documented link between acute or
chronic psychological stress and immune markers29. The stress
resulting from socioeconomic deprivation has been linked to changesin immune response and wider detrimental health effects
30,31.H o w -
ever, in this study, socioeconomic differences in self-reported recov-ery status were not corroborated by different changes in speci ﬁc
symptoms over time, other than a weak association with hearingproblems. Therefore, it is also plausible that more deprived groups
have less capacity to adapt their lives to ongoing health problems or
poorer access to support.
In our study, 70.7% of previously infected people who provided
12-month follow-up data had at least one symptom at 12 months fol-lowing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estimates from previous longitudinalstudies ranged from 28%
12to 77%18. Our 12-month prevalence rates of
speci ﬁc symptoms were comparable to those reported in a random-
effects meta-analysis of 18 studies2: fatigue/weakness (28% versus
28%), dyspnoea (24% versus 18%), arthromyalgia (24% versus 26%),depression (21% versus 23%), and concentration dif ﬁculties or confu-
sion (15% versus 18%). However, the high prevalence of these symp-toms among people never infected reinforces the importance of acomparison group, as does the increase over time in the prevalence ofat least one symptom in this group (from 54% to 57% between 6- and 12-month follow-up, and from 52% to 55% between 6- and 18-month fol-low-up).
The major strengths of our study included national, non-selective
coverage, self-reported plus laboratory-con ﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion status, and inclusion of a comparison group, never infected overthe same period of the pandemic. Other studies have relied on historiccontrols or controls sampled earlier in the pandemic
16. Recovery sta-
tus, ongoing symptoms and quality of life were not subject to recallbias because participants reported them at the time of completingquestionnaires. Follow-up to 18 months is longer than previouslyreported. While every adult in Scotland with a positive SARS-CoV-2PCR test was invited to take part in the study, participation wasvoluntary, so response bias is possible.
A study limitation was that differential attrition by exposure could
not be assessed within the permissions of the data sharing agreementbecause the researchers could not identify the individuals who movedfrom the negative to infected group. Furthermore, it is possible thatsome individuals in the comparison group had SARS-CoV-2 infectionthat was not detected by a PCR test. This risk was reduced by excludingfrom the analyses 53,530 participants who had only negative PCR testsrecorded but who reported that they had had SARS-CoV-2 infection.However, classi ﬁcation error due to undiagnosed, asymptomatic
infection remains. A further limitation, associated with any observa-tional study, is residual confounding due to unknown or unmeasured
confounders.
In conclusion, while long-COVID appeared to be a stable condition
in many, both improvement and deterioration occurred in others.Improvements in altered taste, smell and confusion were reassuring. Incontrast, the ﬁndings of late-onset cough and hearing problems one
year following infection, that could not be explained by backgroundtrends or confounding, merit further investigation.
Methods
Study design and participants
The Long-COVID in Scotland Study (Long-CISS) is an ambidirectional,general population cohort. The National Health Service Scotland
notiﬁcation platform for SARS-CoV-2 PCR results was used to identify
eligible participants and invite them via automated SMS text messages.Every adult (>16 years) in Scotland with a positive PCR test from April2020 was invited along with a comparison group who had had anegative test but never a positive test (hereafter referred to as neverTable 2 (continued) | Characteristics of participants by infecti on status and recovery status trajectory between 6 and 12 months

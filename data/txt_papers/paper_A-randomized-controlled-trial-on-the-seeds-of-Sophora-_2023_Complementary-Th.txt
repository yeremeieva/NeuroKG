Withdrawal ABSTRACT  
Background: and purpose: The seeds of Sophora alopecuroides var. alopecuroides have attenuated the acute opium 
withdrawal syndrome in humans. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of a standardized extract of the plant for the 
treatment of acute heroin withdrawal syndrome was evaluated in abstinent heroin addicts. 
Materials and methods: The patients were randomized to take three 400 mg extract capsules (N 50) or placebo 
(N 50) once per day orally for eight days. The severity of withdrawal syndrome was assessed by the clinical 
opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) as the primary outcome measure at the baseline and on the days 3 and 8. The 
hepatic and renal functions and complete blood count were the secondary outcome measures tested at the 
baseline and end of the study. 
Results: The COWS score decreased in both groups after eight days, but the decrease was significantly higher in 
the experimental group (p D0.001); the effect size of the decrease was 2.64. The groups had significant dif-
ferences in the COWS scores on the days 3 and 8 (p D0.001 for both). The extract had no significant effect on the 
other parameters. No side effect was noted. 
Conclusion: The extract seems to alleviate acute heroin withdrawal syndrome safely.   
1.Introduction 
Addiction to heroin and opium is common and associated with 
morbidities and mortalities which cause huge costs [1,2]. Heroin and 
opium have differences in chemistry, pharmacokinetics and pharmaco -
dynamics [3,4]. Heroin (3, 6-diacetylmorphine) is a semisynthetic de-
rivative of morphine and a prodrug [4], and morphine is the main 
constituent of opium [2]. The effects of opium are primarily due to 
morphine [2]. As heroin is more lipid-soluble than morphine, its entry 
into brain is faster than morphine. Heroin is rapidly metabolized to the 
active metabolites 6-acetylmorphine and morphine in the brain. Heroin 
has faster onset of action and more severe effects than morphine. The 
nature and duration of acute heroin and opium withdrawal syndromes 
are comparable [4]. The acute heroin withdrawal syndrome begins after 
4–6 h, peaks on day 3 and lasts for 6–10 days [5]. The acute heroin 
withdrawal syndrome is more intense than acute opium withdrawal. 
Thus, data about treatment of opium withdrawal may not apply to 
heroin [6]. Treatment of opioid addiction has 2 goals: first, treatment of acute withdrawal syndrome or detoxification and second, maintenance 
treatment [7]. Treatment of acute withdrawal syndrome facilitates 
abstinence from opioid and retention of patients in treatment programs 
[7]. Maintenance treatment maintains abstinence and prevents relapse 
to addiction [7]. Mu-opioid receptor agonists (e.g., methadone), 
μ-opioid receptor partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine), and α2-adren -
ergic receptor agonists (e.g., lofexidine) are the standard drugs used for 
the treatment of acute heroin withdrawal syndrome [7]. 
Medicinal plants are one of the modalities of treatment of the opioid 
withdrawal syndrome [8]. Decoction of the seeds of Sophora alopecur -
oides var. alopecuroides (S. alopecuroides ) is used for the treatment of 
heroin, opium, methamphetamine and nicotine addiction, and pain and 
diarrhea in the Iranian folk medicine [9,10]. Also, S. alopecuroides 400 
mg extract capsules are manufactured for the treatment of acute opium 
withdrawal syndrome in Iran. The S. alopecuroides extract was as 
effective as methadone in suppressing the morphine withdrawal in mice 
[9]. Also, three 400 mg extract capsules once daily for 8 days safely 
mitigated the acute opium withdrawal in a randomized controlled trial

2[10]. However, there has been no research into the effects of 
S. alopecuroides on the acute heroin withdrawal. Moreover, the efficacy 
and safety of S. alopecuroides for the treatment of opioid withdrawal 
needs further research. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the 
efficacy and safety of the S. alopecuroides extract in the treatment of the 
acute heroin withdrawal. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Plant 
The seeds of the plant were collected from the Kerman Province 
(Iran) in November 2019 and a voucher specimen of the plant (number 
1012-IMPH) was deposited in the Herbarium of Institute of Medicinal 
Plants (Karaj, Iran). 
2.2. Extraction 
Five kilograms of the seed powder were macerated in 90% ethanol 
for 3 days during which ethanol was changed 3 times. The extract was 
filtered, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and after mixing the 
extract with toast powder, 427 g of dry powder of the extract was pro-
duced. The yield of extraction was 11%. 
2.3. Extract and placebo capsules 
Oral gelatin capsules were filled with 400 mg of the extract powder 
as drug or toast powder as placebo using a hand-operated capsule-filling 
machine. The extract and placebo capsules were produced according to 
the good manufacturing practices guidelines in the Institute of Medicinal 
Plants (Karaj, Iran) under supervision of the Ministry of Health of Iran. 
The extract and placebo capsules were indistinguishable in every 
respect. 
2.4. Extraction and quantification of the alkaloids 
The extract was standardized by quantification of the main alkaloids 
by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
according to a previous study [10]. First, the alkaloids were extracted as 
follows. Two hundred mL of CHCl 3– CH3 OH– NH4OH (15: 5: 1) was 
added to 600 mg of 90% ethanol extract for 10 min. After filtration, the 
residue was washed with 200 mL of solution twice. The pooled filtrate 
was evaporated to dryness. Five mL of CHCl 3 and 2 mL of 1 N H2SO4 
were added to the residue and the solution was mixed. The CHCl 3 phase 
was removed and the pH of H2SO4 phase was adjusted to pH 10 with 
28% NH4OH. Alkaloids were extracted once with 2 mL and twice with 1 
mL of CHCl 3 from the solution. The combined extracts were filtered after 
adding anhydrous Na2SO4 and were evaporated to dryness at 40 •C (265 
mg). Then, the extraction of alkaloids was analyzed on a Younglin Acm 
600 instrument with a flow ionization detector (FID) operated with a 
split/splitless injector (Younglin, Korea) and DB-5 capillary column (30 
m ×0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) (Agilent, USA). Carrier gas 
was helium. Linear velocity was 30 cm/s. Flow was 0.8 mL/min. In-
jection temperature was 290 •C. Injection volume was 1.0 μL. Injection 
mode was split (1:50).Temperature program was 50 •C for 5 min rising 
at 3 •C/min to 240 •C, then rising at 15 •C/min to 300 •C, and held at 
300 •C for 3 min. Temperature of FID was 290 •C. H2 flow was 50 mL/ 
min. Air flow was 400 mL/min. GC-MS analysis was performed by an 
Agilent 6890/5973 N instrument and DB-5 capillary column (30 m ×
0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). Carrier gas was helium. Linear 
velocity was 32.4 cm/s. Flow was 0.8 mL/min. Injection temperature 
was 290 •C. Injection volume was 1.0 μL. Injection mode was split 
(1:10). Temperature program was 50 •C for 5 min rising at 3 •C/min to 
240 •C, then rising at 15 •C/min to 300 •C, and held at 300 •C for 3 min. 
MS interface temperature was 290 •C. MS mode was EI. Ionization 
voltage was 70 eV. Mass range was 40–500 u. Scan speed was 3.18 scans/sec. Interval was 0.50 s (2 Hz). Data handling was conducted 
using a Chem. Station (Agilent, USA). 
The retention indices of the compounds of the extraction of alkaloids 
were calculated using the retention times of injected n-alkanes (C8–C28) 
(obtained from Fluka) under the same chromatographic conditions. 
Afterward, the compounds were identified by comparison of their 
retention indices and fragmentation patterns of mass spectra with those 
in the literature or WILEY library. Also, the percentages of the identified 
alkaloids were calculated based on GC peak areas without any correc -
tion factors. 
2.5. Clinical trial 
2.5.1. Design, location and duration of the trial 
This trial was randomized, placebo-controlled and triple-blind, 
conducted in a residential addiction treatment center named Izad 
Mehr Setayesh (Karaj city, Iran) between February 2020 and June 2021. 
2.5.2. Ethics and trial registration 
The Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences 
approved the study protocol (code of ethical approval: IR.IUMS. 
REC.1398.1128; date: 8 February 2020). Also, the study was registered 
in the Iranian Registry for Clinical Trials (code: 
IRCT20090804002288N16). 
2.5.3. Sample size 
Given the score of COWS (clinical opiate withdrawal scale) as the 
primary outcome, study power of 80%, effect size of 0.6 between 
experimental and control groups, type 1 error of 0.5, and attrition rate of 
10%, the sample size of each of the experimental and control groups was 
calculated at 50 patients. The effect size was calculated empirically. 
Calculation of sample size was prospective. 
2.5.4. Patients 
Urine was analyzed on arrival of the patients at the treatment center. 
Urine was analyzed for detection of 6-acetylmorphine (a metabolite of 
heroin) by GC-MS [11]. Also, urine was analyzed for detection of 
amphetamine, buprenorphine, benzodiazepine, cocaine, methadone, 
methamphetamine, morphine, tetrahydrocannabinol, tramadol and tri-
cyclic antidepressants using the kits of the Farafan Diagnostics Company 
(Tehran, Iran). 
The inclusion criteria were as follows. Male volunteer patients aged 
18–70 years; addiction to heroin according to the DSM-5 criteria for at 
least 1 year; detection of 6-acetylmorphine in the urine; residence in the 
addiction treatment center; using a fixed dose of heroin for at least 1 
month before the study; and lack of heroin use for at least 5 h before 
arriving at the treatment center. 
The excluded patients were those abusing substances other than 
heroin (except for cigarette), and patients with psychiatric, heart, kid-
ney, liver and organic brain diseases and mental retardation. 
The attrition criteria were occurrence of any intolerable side effect 
attributable to the extract or placebo during the study, and personal 
desire of patients to withdraw from the study. 
After taking the informed written consent forms, demographic, 
disease-related and patient-related data were recorded, and blood 
samples were taken for biochemical analyses. In addition, COWS ques-
tionnaire was completed for each patient, and the patients ’ satisfaction 
with the extract and placebo was rated. 
2.5.5. Randomization 
The patients were allocated to experimental and control groups 
through the block randomization method with an allocation ratio of 1:1. 
This allocation ratio increases the power of study and is usually used. For 
block randomization, all possible forms of blocks for drug and placebo 
with block sizes of 4 were created and then selected randomly using the 
table of randomized numbers. Finally, a randomization list consisting of F. Hashem-Dabaghian and S. Kianbakht                                                                                                                                                                                                   Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice 51 (2023) 101740
3the patients ’ numbers and their allocated treatments was created. For 
concealment of allocation, the number of each patient was written on 
the external part of an envelope, and the treatment of each patient was 
written on a paper inside the envelope. 
2.5.6. Blinding 
Similar capsules with the same amount of the extract and placebo, 
and similar containers, and packages were used in both groups. The 
patients, physician who assessed the signs and symptoms of patients, 
and data analyzer did not know anything about the allocated treatments. 
The randomization list was decoded at the end of the study. 
2.5.7. Interventions 
The patients took 3 extract or placebo capsules once per day after 
meal for 8 days under direct supervision. The dose regimen was ac-
cording to a previous study [10]. Given that the average duration of the 
acute heroin withdrawal syndrome is 8 days [5], the treatment period 
was 8 days. Also, the times of assessment of the patients (days 1, 3, and 
8) were according to the previous study [10]. In the previous study [10], 
we found empirically that the average duration of acute withdrawal 
syndrome of short-acting opioids like opium and heroin was 8 days and 
the severity of the withdrawal syndrome reached a maximum on the day 
3, declined thereafter, and reached a minimum on the day 8. The pa-
tients did not go out of the treatment center or receive any adjunctive 
therapy or drug except the extract or placebo capsules during the trial. 
Notably, the patients are not treated with any therapy in the residential 
addiction treatment centers of Iran. Also, there was no follow-up after 
this study. 
2.5.8. Outcomes 
COWS is a questionnaire that scores 11 common signs and symptoms 
of acute opioid (like heroin) withdrawal, i.e. gooseflesh, tearing or 
runny nose, bone and joint pain, pinpoint pupils, irritability or anxiety, 
tremor, yawning, restlessness, perspiration, tachycardia and gastroin -
testinal discomfort. Each score indicates the symptom severity and total 
score of COWS shows the severity of acute opioid withdrawal syndrome 
as “mild ” (scores 5–12), “moderate ” (scores 13–24), “moderately se-
vere ” (scores 25–36) and " severe " (scores F36) [12]. Clinical use of 
COWS is common and COWS validity as a tool for measuring the severity 
of acute opioid withdrawal syndrome has been demonstrated [13]. 
COWS was assessed at the baseline and on the days 1, 3, and 8. The 
patients ’ satisfaction with the extract and placebo was evaluated by an 
11-point visual analogue scale (VAS). At the baseline and on day 8, CBC 
(complete blood count); blood urea nitrogen (BUN); and the blood levels 
of creatinin (Cr); prothrombin time (PT); total, direct and indirect bili-
rubins (TB, DB and IB); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); alanine amino -
transferase (ALT); and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were 
determined by an autoanalyzer (Hitachi 917, Japan). The patients were 
asked to report any abnormal health issue and side effect to the physi -
cian of the treatment center. The physician was a psychiatrist who 
completed the COWS questionnaire, evaluated the patients ’ satisfaction, 
and asked open-ended questions about side effects. The total score of 
COWS was the primary outcome measure and VAS, CBC, BUN, Cr, PT, 
TB, DB, IB, ALP, ALT, AST and side effects were secondary outcome 
measures. 
2.5.9. Statistical analyses 
Data were analyzed using the version 17 of the SPSS software. Mean 
±standard deviation or median (inter-quartile range) was used for 
description of the quantitative parameters. Frequency was used for 
description of the qualitative parameters. The qualitative parameters of 
the groups were compared by the Chi-squared test. The normality of 
distribution of quantitative parameters was evaluated by the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The quantitative parameters of the two 
groups were compared by the Student ’s t or Mann-Whitney U test. In 
addition, Friedman test was used to analyze the changes of COWS scores during the study. The standardized mean difference between the 
decrease of COWS scores of the experimental and control groups was 
calculated for determination of the effect size. P-values D0.05 were 
statistically significant. The method of data analysis was intention-to- 
treat. 
3.Results 
3.1. Quantification of the alkaloids 
Sophocarpine (35.92%), matrine (28.12%) and sophoramine 
(8.57%) were the major alkaloids of the extract. 
3.2. Clinical trial 
The eligibility of 524 patients was assessed. One hundred patients 
were included in the study and randomly allocated to the experimental 
and control groups. Fifty patients in each group completed the trial. 
Fig. 1 shows the CONSORT flow diagram. The results of Kolmogorov- 
Smirnov test and patients ’ demographics are set forth in Tables 1 and 
2, respectively. The COWS score decreased in both groups after 8 days, 
but the decrease was significantly more in the experimental group 
compared to the control group (p D0.001) (Table 3, Fig. 2); the effect 
size of the decrease as compared between the experimental and control 
groups was 2.64. The COWS scores of the experimental and control 
groups were significantly different on the days 3 and 8 (p D0.001 for 
both) (Table 3, Fig. 2). The withdrawal severity decreased in the 
experimental group sooner than the control group (Table 3, Fig. 2). The 
VAS score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that 
of the control group (7.18 ±2.13 vs 0.62 ±1.79, p D0.001). There was 
no significant difference between the values of blood parameters of the 
experimental and control groups. Residual withdrawal syndrome was 
observed in the patients, but no side effect was detected. 
4.Discussion 
The aim of this study was examination of the efficacy and safety of 
S. alopecuroides for the treatment of acute heroin withdrawal in the 
abstinent heroin addicts residing in a treatment center. The results show 
that sophocarpine, matrine and sophoramine were the main alkaloids of 
the extract. The severity of withdrawal syndrome surged on the day 3 in 
the control group, but it declined on the days 3 and 8 in the experimental 
group. Also, the severity of withdrawal syndrome reduced significantly 
in the experimental versus the control group on the days 3 and 8. Despite 
the blood tests and inquiry about side effects, no side effect was noted. 
More satisfaction of the patients with the extract versus placebo is also 
notable. Body mass index was added to the demographics only for giving 
an impression of the heights and weights of the patients. The results 
seem to be generalizable to the population with the characteristics 
mentioned in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study. 
The results are consistent with the study indicating blockade of the 
morphine withdrawal syndrome by the extract of S. alopecuroides in 
mice [9]. Matrine, cytisine, sophoridine, n-methyl cytisine, sopho -
carpine and sophoramine were the major alkaloids of the extract in the 
aforementioned study [9]. The present study indicates that in spite of 
the fact that cytisine, sophoridine and n-methyl cytisine were not the 
major alkaloids in the extract of this study, the extract mitigated acute 
heroin withdrawal syndrome. The alkaloid composition, withdrawal 
suppressing effects, and safety of the extract used in this study are 
similar to those of the extract used in the trial evaluating the effects of 
the extract on the acute opium withdrawal [10]. Importantly, the 
baseline COWS scores in this study were in the moderate to severe range, 
while those of the just-mentioned trial [10] were in the mild range. 
Notably, the severity of acute heroin withdrawal syndrome is typically 
moderate to severe, whereas the severity of acute opium withdrawal 
syndrome is usually mild [6]. F. Hashem-Dabaghian and S. Kianbakht                                                                                                                                                                                                   Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice 51 (2023) 101740
4According to pharmacological studies discussed below, the alkaloids 
of the extract including sophocarpine, matrine and sophoramine may 
play a role in the effects observed in this trial. The alkaloid fraction and 
matrine were responsible for the blockade of morphine withdrawal by 
the extract in mice [9]. Also, the extract, its alkaloid fraction and 
matrine blocked naloxone-induced diarrhea in morphine-dependent 
mice [9]. A study suggested that sophocarpine had peripheral and 
central analgesic properties in the hot plate and acetic acid-induced writhing tests in mice [14]. However, according to another study, 
( )-sophocarpine and ( )-sophoramine did not show analgesic action in 
the acetic acid-induced writhing and tail flick tests in mice [15]. Various 
studies have reported analgesic effect of matrine. In a study, ()-matrine 
exerted analgesic effect via μ and κ opioid receptors in the acetic 
acid-induced writhing, tail flick and hot plate tests in mice [16,17]. In 
another study, ()-matrine had no in vitro binding for the μ, κ and δ 
opioid receptors and exerted anti-nociceptive effect in the writhing, 
tail-pressure and hot plate models in mice through several mechanism(s) 
such as cholinergic stimulation in the central nervous system rather than 
direct action on the opioid receptors [18]. It is noteworthy that agonists 
of nicotinic receptor may reduce severity of opioid withdrawal syn-
drome [19]. Thus, theoretically, matrine might attenuate opioid with-
drawal via stimulation of the nicotinic receptors. Further, matrine 
alleviated the neuropathic pain due to chronic nerve constriction in mice 
[20]. Matrine decreased the pain produced by mechanical stimulus and

5cold in a mouse model of vincristine-induced neuropathic pain [21]. 
Synergism of the analgesic activity of matrine and paracetamol has been 
reported in the mouse acetic acid-induced writhing test [22]. Also, it is 
noteworthy that several studies have suggested that matrine may have 
anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effects. Matrine exhibited 
anti-depressant effect in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests 
in mice via stimulation of the hippocampus phosphatidylinositol 3-kin -
ase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling [23]. Matrine had 
anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity in the plus-maze, light-dark, 
open-field, forced swimming and tail suspension models following an 
acute burn injury in mice through modulation of the c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor/vascular endothelial 
growth factor pathways [24]. Matrine demonstrated anxiolytic and 
anti-depressant effects in the open field, plus maze, light-dark, forced 
swimming and tail suspension models in mice with carbon 
tetrachloride-induced liver injury through anti-inflammatory, anti--
oxidative, nerve-growing and anti-apoptotic actions [25]. Moreover, the 
extract had analgesic effect in the rat formalin model of pain which was 
not antagonized by naloxone, and did not produce Straub reaction in 
mice, indicating the extract is a non-opioid and may not produce the 
opioid side effects (physical dependence, constipation and respiratory 
depression) [26]. Of note, despite the millennia-long use of 
S. alopecuroides in the Central and Western Asia, the plant is not 
considered as addictive [9,27]. As regards the extract mechanism of 
action, standard drugs for the treatment of opioid withdrawal including 
acute heroin withdrawal act through μ receptor agonism (methadone 
and buprenorphine) or α2 adrenoceptor agonism (lofexidine) [28]. 
Mechanism of the opioid withdrawal reducing effect of the extract is 
unclear. It can be concluded from the above data that non-opioid 
mechanisms like α2 adrenoceptor agonism might mediate the opioid 
withdrawal suppressing effect of the extract. It should also be noted that 
diarrhea, pain, anxiety and dysphoria are among the signs and symp -
toms of opioid withdrawal syndrome [7, 1213], and stimulation of 
nicotinic receptors alleviates the syndrome [19]. Therefore, the antidi -
arrheal effects of the extract and matrine [9]; analgesic effects of 
sophocarpine [14], matrine [16–18,20–22] and extract [26]; antianx -
iety and antidepressant effects of matrine [23–25); and nicotinic re-
ceptor stimulating effect of matrine [18] could be involved in the acute 
heroin withdrawal reducing effect of the extract. One of the limitations 
of this study is lack of comparison of the extract effects with the standard 
pharmacotherapies of opioid withdrawal syndrome. Further, some of the standard drugs used in the treatment of opioid withdrawal syndrome 
may produce cardiac arrhythmias or hypotension [7,29]. Thus, other 
limitations of this study are lack of examination of the extract effects on 
the patients ’ electrocardiogram and vital signs like blood pressure. To 
sum up, the extract alone seems to safely mitigate the moderate to severe 
acute heroin withdrawal. 
5.Conclusion 
Oral intake of three 400 mg extract capsules once daily after meal for 
8 days may safely alleviate moderate to severe acute heroin withdrawal. 
Also, the patients seem to be more satisfied with the extract than pla-
cebo. The extract main alkaloids were sophocarpine, matrine and 
sophoramine. The compounds and mechanisms involved in the opioid 
withdrawal suppressing effect of the extract, and efficacy and safety of 
the extract for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction should be 
ascertained.

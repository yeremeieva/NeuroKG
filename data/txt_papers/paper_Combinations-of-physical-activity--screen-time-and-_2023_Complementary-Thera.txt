Child ABSTRACT  
Background: Subjective wellbeing is an important indicator of health outcomes in children. 24-hour movement 
behaviours (i.e., physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep and their combination), a set of modifiable lifestyle 
behaviours, have been demonstrated to be associated with subjective wellbeing. Thus, the aim of this study was 
to investigate the relationship between the compliance of the 24-h movement guidelines and subjective well-
being in a sample of Chinese children. 
Methods: Cross-sectional data from primary and secondary school students in Anhui Province, China were used 
for the analysis. A total of 1098 study participants (mean age: 11.6 years, body mass index: 19.7 ±2.9) were 
included, of which 51.5% were boys. Physical activity, screen time, sleep, and subjective wellbeing were 
measured using validated self-reported questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to 
assess the relationships between the compliance of different combinations of 24-h movement guidelines and 
subjective wellbeing in participants. 
Results: The compliance of (i.e., physical activity recommendations, screen time recommendations and sleep 
recommendations) 24-h movement guidelines was associated with better subjective wellbeing (OR: 2.09; 95CI%: 
1.01 –5.90) compared to the compliance of none of the guidelines. Furthermore, there was a dose –response 
relationship between the number of guidelines met (3 F2 F1 F0) and improved subjective wellbeing (p D
0.05). Despite some exceptions, there was a significant relationship between the compliance of different com-
binations of the guidelines and better subjective wellbeing. 
Conclusion: This study found that the compliance of 24-h movement guidelines was associated with greater 
subjective wellbeing in Chinese children.   
1.Introduction 
Globally there are more than 1.3 billion children, representing 16% 
of the whole world population [1,2]. Although childhood and adoles -
cence are considered as critical stages of healthy development, 6.64 
million children die every year due to transport, self-harm, interpersonal 
violence and other factors [3], resulting into more children experiencing 
a variety of diseases and injuries [4]. There has been a remarkable 
improvement in the overall health of children in recent decades, but the 
burden of nonfatal health losses has increased over the past decades [4]. 
Therefore, mental health problems are a major global health burden in 
children [5]. Substantial evidence illustrates that mental health prob-
lems during childhood and adolescence can affect their future physical 
and mental health [6–10]. Subjective wellbeing (SWB) reflects the positive aspects of mental health, and therefore SWB is an important 
indicator of mental health research [11]. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that higher levels of depression 
and anxiety are associated with lower SWB [12–14]. Moreover, higher 
SWB is associated with enhanced immune status, as well as reduced 
inflammation, musculoskeletal pain, and risk of mortality [15–17]. 
Therefore, SWB is an important element related to overall health. Pre-
vious research has illustrated that healthy movement behaviours are 
associated with SWB in children [18,19], and evidence on the associa -
tion between movement behaviours and SWB in children is increasingly 
accumulating [20–22]. Movement behaviour compositions, physical 
activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB) and sleep, are independently 
associated with SWB. Previous evidence demonstrates the benefits of 
sufficient PA [23,24], limited SB [25,26], and adequate sleep [27] on

2physical and mental health. Emerging evidence indicates that all 24-h 
movement behaviours ’ compositions should be considered concur -
rently [28], because studying one movement behaviour in isolation 
would neglect the impact of other movement behaviours on health 
outcomes [29]. Consequently, Canada launched the first evidence-based 
24-h movement guidelines in 2016 [30], which was subsequently fol-
lowed by Australia, South Africa, and other countries [31]. In these 
guidelines, children are recommended to engage in at least 60 min of 
moderate to vigorous PA per day, limit recreational screen time (ST) to 
less than 2 h per day, and maintain a sleep duration of 9–11 h (5–13 
years old) or 8–10 h (14–17 years old) [30]. However, previous studies 
have reported a low prevalence of the compliance of 24-h movement 
guidelines among children [32–34]. Meanwhile, due to the impact of the 
COVD-19 pandemic, the prevalence of compliance of the guidelines is 
now significantly lower than that before the outbreak [35–37]. 
Recently, there has been a growing interest in the relationship be-
tween the compliance of 24-h movement guidelines and SWB in chil-
dren. A previous systematic review found that, in children, greater PA 
was associated with higher SWB, while more SB was associated with 
lower SWB [38]. Furthermore, a relationship between longer sleep 
duration and higher SWB was reported in a systematic review [27]. 
However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the 
compliance of 24-h movement guidelines and SWB in children since the 
COVID-19 pandemic. One study from Switzerland investigated the 
relationship between the compliance of 24-h movement guidelines and 
SWB in 2534 children aged 5–16 years, and found that participants who 
met the 24-h movement guidelines had higher levels of SWB [42]. 
Moreover, even meeting any one or a combination of any two recom -
mendations of the guidelines was associated with higher SWB compared 
to meeting none of the 24-h movement guidelines [42,43 ]. Furthermore, 
there is also a lack of demographically representative studies investi -
gating the relationship between the compliance of 24-h movement 
guidelines and SWB. 
Consequently, the present study aimed to explore the association 
between the compliance of 24-h movement guidelines and SWB in a 
sample of Chinese children. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Study design and study participants 
This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Anhui Province, China 
in 2021. This survey aimed to understand children ’s lifestyle behaviours 
and health, where study participants were recruited via a convenience 
sampling strategy. Participants completed an anonymous online ques-
tionnaire in the computer rooms in their schools. More than 2000 stu-
dents were invited to take part in this study. Finally, 1098 school-aged 
students were included in this study after deleting invalid question -
naires. This survey study was approved by the West Anhui University 
and permission to conduct the study survey was obtained from the 
teachers and principals of each participating schools. All participants 
and their parents or guardians provided formal signed consent. 
2.2. Measures 
2.2.1. Dependent variables 
SWB was measured using the Chinese version of the World Health 
Organization Five-Item Well-being Index (WHO-5) [37]. Participants 
reported the presence of positive feelings in the last 2 weeks on a six- 
point scale (5 all the time, 0 never). The possible total score of 
the WHO-5 ranges from 0 to 25, and a higher score indicates better 
subjective wellbeing. Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of 
WHO-5 have been validated among Chinese children [38, 39]. 
2.2.2. Independent variables 
Sleep duration was measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the question is that “How many hours did you actually 
sleep at night in the past month? ” The Chinese version of the PSQI has 
been validated among Chinese children [44]. ST was measured using the 
relevant items from the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) 
survey, including the time spent on various screen-based activities (i.e., 
watching TV, playing games with computers, chatting online with 
computers, etc.) in the past seven days. This questionnaire has been 
applied by many previous studies to investigate screen time in Chinese 
children [45,46], with acceptable reliability and validity. The average 
daily ST was calculated using the following formula: ([sum of ST in 
weekdays ×5] [sum of weekend ST ×2])/7 [47]. MVPA was also 
measured using the relevant items from the HBSC survey, which asked 
about the number of days that included at least 60 min of MVPA in the 
past week. Items measuring ST and MVPA have been shown to have 
satisfactory reliability in Chinese children [48]. According to the Ca-
nadian 24-h movement guidelines [49], reporting 7 days with more than 
60 min of MVPA was considered “meeting the PA guidelines ”; no more 
than 2 h of ST per day was considered “meeting the ST guidelines ”; sleep 
duration for 9–11 h and 8–10 h in children (5–12 years) and adolescents 
(13–17 years), respectively, was considered “meeting the sleep guide -
lines ”. Taken together, the combined cases of meeting the three guide -
lines can be determined as either the number of guidelines met (i.e., 
none, one, two, or all three) or specific combinations of 24-h movement 
guidelines met (i.e., none, MVPA only, ST only, sleep only, MVPA ST, 
MVPA sleep, ST sleep, MVPA ST sleep). 
2.2.3. Covariables 
The following information was also gathered: sex (male/female), 
age, self-reported height (cm) and weight (kg), and family socioeco -
nomic status (SES). Self-reported height and weight were also required 
for body mass index assessment according to China ’s norm-referenced 
data [50]. Family SES was measured using the adapted version of the 
MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status with a range from 0–10 
[51]. 
2.3. Statistical analysis 
Descriptive statistics were used to report sample characteristics. 
Generalised linear model analyses were used to examine the associations 
between SWB and meeting a general combination (the number of 
guidelines met, ranging from one to three) or specific combinations 
(none/sleep only/screen only/MVPA only/sleep screen/sleep 
MVPA/screen MVPA/all) of 24-h movement guidelines after con-
trolling for age, sex, body mass index and family socioeconomic status. A 
p-value lower than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. 
3.Results 
3.1. Sample characteristics 
Table 1 shows sample characteristics of participants in this study. In 
total, 1098 school-attending students were included for the final anal-
ysis. The percentages of boys and girls were 51.5% and 48.5%, respec -
tively. The mean age of study participants was 11.6 ±0.8 years, and the 
average BMI was 19.7 ±2.9 kg/m2. In terms of results for the compli -
ance of the guidelines, the proportion of study participants meeting the 
sleep guidelines was 23.3%, and 8.7% of study participants met the 
screen guidelines. Approximately 59% of study participants met the 
MVPA guidelines. Regarding the 24-h movement guidelines, only 1.5% 
of study participants met the entire guidelines, and 30.0% of study 
participants met none of the guidelines. The proportion of participants 
who met the guidelines for sleep guidelines only, screen time guidelines 
only, and MVPA guidelines only was 9.3%, 39.8%, and 2.0%, respec -
tively. In terms of the compliance of different combinations of the 
guidelines, the percentage of participants: meeting the sleep screen 
time guidelines was 12.3%, meeting the sleep MVPA guidelines in J. Sun et al.

3combination was 0.2%, and meeting the screen time MVPA guidelines 
in combination was 4.9%. In terms of the number of guidelines adhered 
to, only 1.5% and 17.4% of study participants met three and two 
guidelines, respectively, but 51.1% of study participants met only one 
guideline. The mean score of SWB was 16.9 with a standard deviation of 
5. 
3.2. Association between the compliance of 24-h movement guidelines 
and subjective wellbeing 
The association of the number of movement behaviour guidelines 
met with SWB among Chinese children is presented in Table 2. After 
adjustment for a set of covariates, there was a significant association 
between the number of 24-h movement guidelines met by study par-
ticipants and better SWB, suggesting the more guidelines met, the higher 
the scores of SWB (p D0.05). 
In Table 3, the association of the compliance of different combina -
tions of 24-h movement guidelines and SWB among Chinese children is 
presented. After adjustment for covariates, the compliance of 24-h 
movement guidelines was associated with improved SWB (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.49 –5.42) compared to meeting none of the guidelines. The 
compliance of the screen time and sleep guidelines in combination was 
not significantly associated with better SWB. Furthermore, compared to 
meeting none of the three guidelines, compliance of sleep guidelines 
only, ST guidelines only, and PA guidelines only was positively associ -
ated with better SWB compared to meeting none of the 24-h movement 
guidelines. 
4.Discussion 
This study is the first cross-sectional study to investigate the rela-
tionship between SWB and the compliance of PA, ST and sleep guide -
lines in a sample of Chinese children. In the present study, the 
compliance of 24-h movement guidelines was associated with higher 
scores of SWB, and there appeared a dose –response relationship be-
tween the number of guidelines met and scores of SWB. The results of 
this study indicated that, in general, better movement behaviours pat-
terns were significantly associated with enhanced SWB in children. 
4.1. Comparison with previous studies 
In terms of the compliance of 24-h movement behaviour guidelines, 
the prevalence of the compliance with screen time and sleep guidelines 
in insolation was similar to previous studies [52,53]. However, the 
prevalence of compliance of PA guidelines in this study was higher than 
that of other previous studies [52,53]. One possible explanation is that 
children tend to overestimate days for PA participations using 
self-reported questionnaires [54]. Several studies have investigated the 
relationships of PA, ST and sleep with SWB in children before and after 
the COVID-19 pandemic [27,38–41]. However, the majority of these 
studies have investigated these three movement behaviours indepen -
dently rather than integrating them on a whole continuum. To the au-
thors ’ best knowledge, only one study by Peralta et al. has investigated 
the relationship between the compliance of 24-h movement guidelines 
and SWB in children [42]. Peralta et al. examined changes in compliance 
with PA, ST and sleep guidelines in 2534 children during the COVID-19 
pandemic in Switzerland, and explored the relationship between the 
compliance of 24-h movement guidelines and SWB [42]. 
Results of the study by Peralta et al. [42] showed that participants 
who met the three movement guidelines had greater SWB than those 
who did not meet any of the guidelines, and that there was a dos-
e–response relationship between the number of guidelines achieved and 
better SWB, which supports the findings of the current study. Further 
exploring the relationship between different combinations of movement 
guidelines and SWB, we found that compared to the compliance of none 
of the integrated guidelines, compliance of all the three guidelines, 
compliance of the PA and sleep guidelines, compliance of the PA and ST 
guidelines, and compliance of the sleep guidelines only, ST guidelines 
only, and PA guidelines only was significantly associated with better Table 1

4SWB. These results differ from the study by Peralta et al. [42]. One 
possible explanation is that different sample characteristics may lead to 
varying research findings [55]. Another potential reason is the differ -
ence in the measurement apporach used to assess SWB. The Cantril 
ladder was used in the Swiss study [42], whereas our study applied a 
different measure. Although both measurements are subjective mea-
sures for SWB, the Cartril ladder mainly focuses on life satisfaction [56], 
while the measure we used targets SWB. Andrews et al. suggest that SWB 
is composed of life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect [57]. 
Previous studies have shown that life satisfaction is one key component 
of SWB [58], while the global SWB is simply the sum of the three 
components [59]. Therefore, the differences in findings may be due to 
different components of SWB being measured. Nevertheless, our study 
provides evidence from a representative sample of children in China and 
demonstrates the relationships between SWB and PA, ST and sleep; thus, 
supporting the need for further investigation into lifestyle movement 
behaviours and SWB in this population. 
4.2. Potential mechanisms 
There are several mechanisms that may explain the current research 
findings in children. First, there is a bidirectional association between 
PA and SWB [60], wherein people with high SWB may be inclined to 
participate more in PA [61]. Second, participation in PA can improve 
physical and mental health, which can further increase life satisfaction 
and SWB. PA can improve self-rated physical health and physical 
function, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity and 
musculoskeletal disease, thus improving SWB [62–66]. Moreover, PA 
can improve SWB by improving body image, self-esteem, elf-efficacy, as 
well as lowering depression, anxiety, etc. [62,63,67–69]. Internal and 
external mechanisms may explain how PA improves SWB. The internal 
mechanisms include the sensations of pleasure, fluency, and climax that 
children experience through PA participation, which leads to more 
enjoyment for improved SWB [70], while the external mechanism is 
concerned with social communication with others through participation 
in PA, which subsequently leads to higher SWB [71]. Moreover, PA may 
activate mood-regulating neurotransmitters in the brain and accelerate 
the production of endorphins, thereby reducing feelings of pain [72,73]. 
Thus, PA could lead to higher SWB in children by reducing their 
perception of pain. Previous research has demonstrated that ST is an 
independent risk factor for both physical and mental health problems 
[14,74,75]. A potential mechanism is that excessive ST can lead to 
children ’s feeling of social isolation, and thus reporting lower SWB [76]. 
Prolonged ST is an independent risk factor for mental disorders such as 
depression and anxiety, and is associated with reduced life satisfaction, 
happiness and self-esteem [38]. Therefore, children who are exposed to 
longer ST may have poorer mental health, and are more likely to develop 
mental disorders; thus, further internalising lower SWB. Furthermore, 
social contact may also be inhibited based on the negative emotions, 
thus making children get more dependent on screens [77]. In children 
insufficient sleep time can lead to significant shifts in hypothal -
amic –pituitary –adrenal axis reactivity, resulting in increased pressure, 
and thus reducing SWB [78]. Moreover, emotional brain networks, rapid 
eye movement sleep-related mechanisms, emotional information pro-
cessing, and the cognitive-energy model may be potential mechanisms 
by which sleep deprivation affects SWB [79]. There may also be a 
bidirectional relationship between sleep duration and SWB [79,80]. 
Taken together, it is reasonable to expect that 24-h movement behav -
iours can affect SWB in children. 
4.3. Limitations and further recommendations 
There are some limitations of this study. First, this study was cross- 
sectionally designed and was unable to identify causal relationships 
between 24-h movement behaviours and SWB. Future research should 
adopt a longitudinal design to better determine the direction of the associations. Second, SWB in this study was only assessed as a global 
score, which may not gain deep insights into movement behaviours and 
SWB. Therefore, future research needs to further investigate the re-
lationships between the different components of SWB and 24-h move -
ment behaviours to draw more specific practical implications. Third, 
although a self-reported questionnaire that used to measure 24-h 
movement behaviours in this study has good validity in children, it is 
unable to avoid the effects of recall and respondent bias. Future studies 
could use validated devices to objectively measure 24-h movement be-
haviours, taking into account the economic feasibility. 
5.Conclusion 
As the first study focusing on the relationship between compliance of 
24-h movement guidelines and SWB in a sample of Chinese children, this 
study found that the compliance of PA, ST, sleep guidelines was asso-
ciated with greater SWB.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an adjustable, reversible, non-destructive neurosurgical
intervention using implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to areas in the brain. DBS is
currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive–compulsivedisorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in bothanimals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with
treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted.
The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature onDBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverseevent data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six
different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum,
lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studiestargeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that
the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory
addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish itssuitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translationalissues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials
with DBS in patients with addiction.

Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical
intervention in which implanted electrodes deliver
electrical pulses to stereotactically targeted areas ofthe brain. It has been used as treatment for move-ment disorders for over 20 years
1and has recently
shown promising results as experimental treatment of
psychiatric disorders such as obsessive–compulsivedisorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome and depressive
disorder
2–4(for review, see Greenberg et al.5). A wide
range of other possible applications for DBS havebeen suggested over the last years
6–8—one of which is
addiction.
The reasons to consider DBS as an intervention for
addiction are threefold. (1) Preclinical studies and
case studies have reported promising results for DBSas a treatment for addiction.9–11(2) The recent under-
standing of neural pathways that are affected inaddiction has created a new range of possibilities fortreatments that directly target and normalize affected
brain circuits. And (3) new effective interventions
are needed for patients who do not benefit fromcurrent treatments, since addiction is a chronic
relapsing brain disorder seriously affecting both
individual and public health.
12A substantial number
of patients suffer multiple relapses and show a
chronic course of the disorder despite several treat-
ments: abstinence rates after 1 year of completingtreatment are about 30–50%.

A well-documented rationale for the choice of the
target area in the brain is required in order to
investigate the effectiveness, safety and feasibility ofDBS in treatment-refractory addiction. Therefore, the
objective of this review is to find the most promising
target area for DBS in addiction. For this purpose, weexamined original published reports on empirical
studies about DBS in addiction in animals and
humans. In the first step, a PubMed search wasconducted using various terms for ‘addiction’ and

www.nature.com/mp‘deep brain stimulation’. In the second step, the
reference lists of all papers from the first step were
screened for additional articles fitting the inclusioncriteria. Only papers that focused on the effectsof DBS on addiction that were written in English
were included. This search resulted in 7 animal
studies (summarized in Table 1) and 11 humanstudies (summarized in Table 2).
We separately discuss the findings from preclinical
and clinical studies taking into account both efficacyand safety for each of the target areas. Specifically,
we discuss (1) which of the target areas used for
DBS in animal research directed at the reduction ofdrug-seeking behaviour has been most effective and
resulted in the least severe side effects, and (2) which
of the target areas used for DBS in humans have beenmost effective in terms of a lasting reduction of drugconsumption and resulted in the least severe side
effects.
Neurocircuitry underlying addiction
Although the neuropathophysiology of addiction can
be appreciated at multiple levels, from the molecularand cellular level to the interplay of networks systems
in the brain, here, given the nature of DBS we focus
on the neuroanatomical brain circuits that wereelucidated by different types of animal and human
imaging research. A useful framework has been
provided by Koob and Volkow
15in a recent review.
According to the authors, the addiction cycle is
characterized by three stages: ‘binge/intoxication’,
‘withdrawal/negative affect’ and ‘preoccupation/anti-cipation’ (craving), and involves aspects of bothimpulsivity and compulsivity. In the binge/intoxica-
tion stage, the nucleus accumbens (NAcs) is consid-
ered to have a key role together with the ventraltegmental area, whereas the extended amygdala is
seen as central structure in the withdrawal/negative
affect phase. A more dispersed network of brainregions is associated with the preoccupation/anti-
cipation phase that is involved in craving and relapse,
processes responsible for the chronic nature of thedisorder. The main brain structures involved in these
processes include the (orbito) frontal cortex, striatum,
amygdala, hippocampus and insula, which are in-volved in subjective experiences of drugs whiledisrupted inhibitory control involves the cingulate
gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior
frontal gyrus. All the brain structures involved couldbe potential targets for DBS. Effective DBS would
optimally interfere with the neuroanatomical circuits
of all three stages.
Animal studies
At time of writing, seven studies have investigated theeffects of DBS in animal models of addiction, using
six different target areas; NAc, subthalamic nucleus
(STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medialprefrontal cortex (mPFC) and lateral hypothalamus(see Table 1 and Figure 1c to h). To test the impact of
DBS on drug-seeking behaviour, different models of
addiction were used in these studies (for a descriptionsee Table 3). In order to have a valid control group,all animals in these experiments were implanted
with electrodes but only the experimental group was
stimulated (DBS ‘on’) whereas the control group wasnot (DBS ‘off’). Typically, the animals were stimu-
lated only before and/or during experiments. Most
studies used continuous high-frequency stimulation( > 100 Hz), although two additionally tested low-
frequency stimulation: 20 and 10 Hz,
10,16while three
gave trains of pulses with pauses in between.10,16,17
With the exception of two studies16,17rats were
stimulated bilaterally. Three different substances
were used in the addiction paradigms; ethanol,cocaine and morphine. DBS effects on sucrose self-administration or water consumption were evaluated
to control for possible side effects in some studies,
while effects on learning/memory or depression-likebehaviour were tested in others.
NAc and dorsal striatum
Four out of seven animal studies targeted the NAc for
DBS (see Figure 1c).17–20All four studies showed a
significant reduction of drug-related behaviours fol-lowing high-frequency DBS in either core or shell.
Two studies examined the effect of DBS on ethanol
consumption,
18,19a third examined the effects of DBS
on reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour,20and
in one study17rats were given morphine in a
conditioned place preference paradigm. There wereno effects of NAc DBS on sucrose self-administrationor water consumption and none of the studies
reported unusual behaviours in the experimental
compared with the control groups. Overall, theseanimal studies suggest that high-frequency NAc DBS
attenuates drug-related behaviour in rats with no
apparent side effects. It should be noted that inaddition to NAc DBS, Vassoler et al.
20also examined
DBS effects in the dorsal striatum (Figure 1h) on
cocaine reinstatement in rats. In contrast to the NAcexperiment, they failed to find any significant effects
on cocaine reinstatement.
STN
Rouaud et al.21examined the effect of high-frequency
STN DBS (Figure 1d) on cocaine and sucrose (food)self-administration. The DBS ‘on’ group showedincreased motivation to work for sucrose but de-
creased motivation to work for cocaine using a
progressive ratio self-administration experiment.However, when every lever-press was followed by a
reward (fixed-ratio 1) no difference was found
between the ‘on’ or ‘off’ group, suggesting that STNstimulation did not affect the consumption of readily
available drugs or sucrose, but made them less willing
to work for cocaine. In addition, no effect of STN DBSwas found on regular food (chow) intake.Review of target areas for DBS in addiction

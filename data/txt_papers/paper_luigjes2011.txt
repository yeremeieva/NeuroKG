Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an adjustable, reversible, non-destructive neurosurgical
intervention using implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to areas in the brain. DBS is
currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive–compulsivedisorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in bothanimals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with
treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted.
The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature onDBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverseevent data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six
different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum,
lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studiestargeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that
the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory
addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish itssuitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translationalissues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials
with DBS in patients with addiction.

Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical
intervention in which implanted electrodes deliver
electrical pulses to stereotactically targeted areas ofthe brain. It has been used as treatment for move-ment disorders for over 20 years
1and has recently
shown promising results as experimental treatment of
psychiatric disorders such as obsessive–compulsivedisorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome and depressive
disorder
2–4(for review, see Greenberg et al.5). A wide
range of other possible applications for DBS havebeen suggested over the last years
6–8—one of which is
addiction.
The reasons to consider DBS as an intervention for
addiction are threefold. (1) Preclinical studies and
case studies have reported promising results for DBSas a treatment for addiction.9–11(2) The recent under-
standing of neural pathways that are affected inaddiction has created a new range of possibilities fortreatments that directly target and normalize affected
brain circuits. And (3) new effective interventions
are needed for patients who do not benefit fromcurrent treatments, since addiction is a chronic
relapsing brain disorder seriously affecting both
individual and public health.
12A substantial number
of patients suffer multiple relapses and show a
chronic course of the disorder despite several treat-
ments: abstinence rates after 1 year of completingtreatment are about 30–50%.

A well-documented rationale for the choice of the
target area in the brain is required in order to
investigate the effectiveness, safety and feasibility ofDBS in treatment-refractory addiction. Therefore, the
objective of this review is to find the most promising
target area for DBS in addiction. For this purpose, weexamined original published reports on empirical
studies about DBS in addiction in animals and
humans. In the first step, a PubMed search wasconducted using various terms for ‘addiction’ and

www.nature.com/mp‘deep brain stimulation’. In the second step, the
reference lists of all papers from the first step were
screened for additional articles fitting the inclusioncriteria. Only papers that focused on the effectsof DBS on addiction that were written in English
were included. This search resulted in 7 animal
studies (summarized in Table 1) and 11 humanstudies (summarized in Table 2).
We separately discuss the findings from preclinical
and clinical studies taking into account both efficacyand safety for each of the target areas. Specifically,
we discuss (1) which of the target areas used for
DBS in animal research directed at the reduction ofdrug-seeking behaviour has been most effective and
resulted in the least severe side effects, and (2) which
of the target areas used for DBS in humans have beenmost effective in terms of a lasting reduction of drugconsumption and resulted in the least severe side
effects.
Neurocircuitry underlying addiction
Although the neuropathophysiology of addiction can
be appreciated at multiple levels, from the molecularand cellular level to the interplay of networks systems
in the brain, here, given the nature of DBS we focus
on the neuroanatomical brain circuits that wereelucidated by different types of animal and human
imaging research. A useful framework has been
provided by Koob and Volkow
15in a recent review.
According to the authors, the addiction cycle is
characterized by three stages: ‘binge/intoxication’,
‘withdrawal/negative affect’ and ‘preoccupation/anti-cipation’ (craving), and involves aspects of bothimpulsivity and compulsivity. In the binge/intoxica-
tion stage, the nucleus accumbens (NAcs) is consid-
ered to have a key role together with the ventraltegmental area, whereas the extended amygdala is
seen as central structure in the withdrawal/negative
affect phase. A more dispersed network of brainregions is associated with the preoccupation/anti-
cipation phase that is involved in craving and relapse,
processes responsible for the chronic nature of thedisorder. The main brain structures involved in these
processes include the (orbito) frontal cortex, striatum,
amygdala, hippocampus and insula, which are in-volved in subjective experiences of drugs whiledisrupted inhibitory control involves the cingulate
gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior
frontal gyrus. All the brain structures involved couldbe potential targets for DBS. Effective DBS would
optimally interfere with the neuroanatomical circuits
of all three stages.
Animal studies
At time of writing, seven studies have investigated theeffects of DBS in animal models of addiction, using
six different target areas; NAc, subthalamic nucleus
(STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medialprefrontal cortex (mPFC) and lateral hypothalamus(see Table 1 and Figure 1c to h). To test the impact of
DBS on drug-seeking behaviour, different models of
addiction were used in these studies (for a descriptionsee Table 3). In order to have a valid control group,all animals in these experiments were implanted
with electrodes but only the experimental group was
stimulated (DBS ‘on’) whereas the control group wasnot (DBS ‘off’). Typically, the animals were stimu-
lated only before and/or during experiments. Most
studies used continuous high-frequency stimulation( > 100 Hz), although two additionally tested low-
frequency stimulation: 20 and 10 Hz,
10,16while three
gave trains of pulses with pauses in between.10,16,17
With the exception of two studies16,17rats were
stimulated bilaterally. Three different substances
were used in the addiction paradigms; ethanol,cocaine and morphine. DBS effects on sucrose self-administration or water consumption were evaluated
to control for possible side effects in some studies,
while effects on learning/memory or depression-likebehaviour were tested in others.
NAc and dorsal striatum
Four out of seven animal studies targeted the NAc for
DBS (see Figure 1c).17–20All four studies showed a
significant reduction of drug-related behaviours fol-lowing high-frequency DBS in either core or shell.
Two studies examined the effect of DBS on ethanol
consumption,
18,19a third examined the effects of DBS
on reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour,20and
in one study17rats were given morphine in a
conditioned place preference paradigm. There wereno effects of NAc DBS on sucrose self-administrationor water consumption and none of the studies
reported unusual behaviours in the experimental
compared with the control groups. Overall, theseanimal studies suggest that high-frequency NAc DBS
attenuates drug-related behaviour in rats with no
apparent side effects. It should be noted that inaddition to NAc DBS, Vassoler et al.
20also examined
DBS effects in the dorsal striatum (Figure 1h) on
cocaine reinstatement in rats. In contrast to the NAcexperiment, they failed to find any significant effects
on cocaine reinstatement.
STN
Rouaud et al.21examined the effect of high-frequency
STN DBS (Figure 1d) on cocaine and sucrose (food)self-administration. The DBS ‘on’ group showedincreased motivation to work for sucrose but de-
creased motivation to work for cocaine using a
progressive ratio self-administration experiment.However, when every lever-press was followed by a
reward (fixed-ratio 1) no difference was found
between the ‘on’ or ‘off’ group, suggesting that STNstimulation did not affect the consumption of readily
available drugs or sucrose, but made them less willing
to work for cocaine. In addition, no effect of STN DBSwas found on regular food (chow) intake.Review of target areas for DBS in addiction

One study used the lateral habenula (Figure 1e) as
target for DBS in a self-administration experimentwith cocaine.
16Stimulation with alternating sets ofhigh- and low-frequency patterns (combined pattern

of DBS applied on the first day of extinction was

six extinction sessions (up to 7–8 days). It should
be noted that no effects were found with only
high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz) on cocaineself-administration, whereas only low-frequencystimulation (10 Hz) resulted in an increase in self-
administration. Additional experiments showed that
the effects that were observed with combined patternDBS were not the result of a decreased ability to press
a lever or depressive-like manifestations. Further-
more, in a separate study from the same group,
22a
significant decrease in lever presses for sucrose after
combined pattern DBS of the lateral habenula was
found.
mPFC and lateral hypothalamus
A somewhat different approach was used by Levy
et al .,10who stimulated the medial PFC (Figure 1f)
of rats 30 min a day for 10 consecutive days duringabstinence after a period of cocaine self-administra-
tion. DBS reduced the number of lever responses for
cocaine, but not for sucrose, in the extinction phaseand under a progressive ratio schedule. Similar
effects were obtained using low-frequency stimula-
tion (20 instead of 100 Hz). These results imply thatrepeated stimulation of the medial PFC could beeffective in reducing addiction-related behaviours at
both high- and low-frequency stimulation. Other
behaviours, including spatial learning and memory
and general locomotor activity were unaffected.Finally, high-frequency stimulation of the lateralhypothalamus (Figure 1g) during 10 days of absti-
nence from cocaine self-administration also resulted
in reduced lever responses during extinction phase,but no effect was found in a progressive ratio
schedule. DBS of the lateral hypothalamus did not
affect sucrose seeking.
10
Taken together, stimulation of the NAc, STN, lateral
habenula and mPFC all seemed to be effective in
reducing various aspects of drug-seeking behaviour ordrug consumption. This was generally achieved
without clear signs of side effects other than food or
water intake. An increase in sucrose-seeking beha-viour was observed in the study using STN stimula-tion
21and a decrease in sucrose seeking was found in
the study with lateral habenula stimulation.16Both
can be considered undesirable side effects because itmight indicate a changed motivation for natural
reinforcers. No effects were found of STN stimulation
on low cost self-administration behaviour suggestingthat stimulation of the STN might reduce the
incentive value of the drugs but not the consumptionTable 3 Animal models of addiction

Molecular Psychiatrywhen the drug is available. Although a cautionary
remark should be made concerning the differences in
stimulation parameters used in these studies (seeTable 1), our conclusion is that stimulating the NAcwith high-frequency DBS or the medial PFC with
both high- and low-frequency DBS seems to result
in the most robust effects. The NAc is the only areathat has been used in different studies, underscoring
the need for preclinical confirmation studies for the
mPFC.
Human case studies
As of today, there are no published randomized
controlled trials on the effect of DBS in alcohol- or
drug-dependent patients. The available clinical evi-dence is restricted to 11 case reports or case series. In
these studies, two target areas have been used: the
NAc and the STN (see Table 2 and Figures 1a and b).Five reports described the NAc as target area for
DBS—three reported on the remission of addiction as
a non-intended side effect of DBS during the treat-ment another psychiatric disorder
9,23,24and in two
studies the indication for DBS was addiction.11,25We
found six reports that described the effects of STN
DBS on addiction; in all these studies the indicationfor DBS was Parkinson’s disease. Here, we provide a
summary of these case studies.
NAc
The first study that examined the effects of NAc DBS
on addiction was a retrospective case series by Kuhnet al.
23They found that 3 out of 10 patients treated
with high-frequency NAc DBS (five bilateral and
five unilateral) for different disorders (for example,depression, OCD) stopped smoking; a much higherquit rate than unaided smoking cessation in the
general population. All patients that retrospectively
reported any attempt to quit smoking after surgerywere successful. Successful quitters were less addi-
cted, more motivated to quit and were stimulated at
higher mean voltages than non-attempters (5.7 versus4.4 V). None of the quitters relapsed during the 30
months follow-up period.
In a single case study,
9a patient was treated with
bilateral high-frequency NAc DBS for severe agora-
phobia with panic attacks and depression. Before
surgery, the patient also met criteria for alcoholdependence. DBS had a negligible effect on theanxiety symptoms, but rapidly and drastically
reduced alcohol consumption without any particular
motivation. The patient claimed to have lost thedesire to drink and felt no longer a pressing need
to consume alcohol. He did not reach abstinence
but reduced his intake to moderate amounts andcontinued this pattern during a 1-year follow-up
period.
Mu¨lleret al .
11were the first to report on three
patients who were treated with bilateral, high-
frequency NAc DBS for alcohol dependence. Patients
were between 36 and 40 years, had been drinkingfrom their early teens and had not responded to
different types of therapy. In all three patients,
craving fully disappeared after NAc DBS; two patientsremained abstinent during 1-year follow-up and theother patient reduced his alcohol consumption con-
siderably. In one patient, a hypomanic episode of
2 weeks was reported that remitted after adaptation ofstimulation parameters. This patient also reduced his
nicotine consumption from 40 to 15 cigarettes per
day. No other side effects were reported.
In another single case study, a patient was success-
fully treated for OCD with bilateral high-frequency
NAc DBS.
24She was a heavy smoker and reported
repeated unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking
before surgery. Ten months after the DBS surgery,
she decided that she no longer wanted to be a smokerand quit the next day. In the 2-year follow-upevaluation, she was still not smoking and there was
no desire to start again.
Finally, Zhou et al.
25described a patient addicted to
heroin who refrained from drug use after bilateral,
high-frequency NAc DBS during follow-up period of
6 years in total. The patient was 24 years old, hadbeen using 1–1.5 g of heroine for over 5 years and did
not respond to any previous interventions. Addition-
ally, he decreased the number of cigarettes he smokedfrom 40 a day before surgery to 10 a day after surgery.
After 2 to 3 years, the pulse generator was first put off
and later removed. Subsequently patient remaineddrug free throughout the 3-year follow-up period.Mild confusion and urinary incontinence were
reported as transient side effects after surgery from
which he fully recovered within 12 h.
STN
Finally, there are several reports in which high-frequency STN DBS in patients with Parkinson’sdisease either induced or reduced addictive behav-iours. Some Parkinson patients treated with dopa-
mine replacement therapy develop an addictive
pattern of medication use called ‘dopamine dysregu-lation syndrome’, which in turn is associated with the
onset of impulse control disorders, including patho-
logical gambling, hypersexuality and compulsiveshopping.
26In four case studies27–30with a total of
12 patients with dopamine dysregulation syndrome
or pathological gambling, bilateral STN DBS resolvedthese addictive behaviours. Importantly, all of these
patients drastically reduced or stopped the use of
levodopa or dopamine agonist treatment. However,another case report
31described a patient without
a history of addictive behaviours who developed a
pattern of pathological gambling after high-frequency
bilateral STN DBS despite a clear reduction oflevodopa and dopamine agonist treatment. In another
study, 19 Parkinson patients with dopamine dysregu-
lation syndrome or impulse control disorders werefollowed after STN DBS treatment (18 bilateral and 1
unilateral).
32The study showed mixed results: in a
small proportion of these patients the addictivebehaviour improved, whereas in the majority of theReview of target areas for DBS in addiction
J Luigjes et al
578
Molecular Psychiatrypatients the addictive behaviour did not improve or
even worsened.32Moreover, the poor outcome on
behavioural symptoms was associated with higherpost-operative use of dopaminergic medication. Sideeffects of STN DBS reported in these case studies
were mild apathy (two patients
27), emotional instabil-
ity and vivid dreaming (one patient31). From these
studies it is difficult to deduce how STN DBS
influences addictive behaviours and what role adap-
tation of dopaminergic medication has in it. More-over, two reports
31,32suggest that high-frequency STN
DBS may in fact increase or induce addictive
behaviour. Finally, several studies have associatedSTN DBS with increased impulsivity,
33–35which has
been linked to addictive behaviours.36In sum, the
potential efficacy and safety of STN DBS for thetreatment of addiction can be called into question.
On the basis of these cases, the NAc appears to be
the most promising and safe target for the use of DBS
in patients with addictive behaviours. However, welike to emphasize that no firm conclusions can be
drawn from uncontrolled case reports and case series.
Although there is a bias towards publishing positiveresults in all scientific articles, selective bias is even
stronger for case reports where positive results will be
published at the expense of negative data making abalanced judgement difficult if not impossible.
37
Therefore, from these case reports one could onlycautiously conclude that the use of STN stimulationto treat addiction seems questionable while stimula-tion of the NAc is promising.
Most promising target area: NAc
The NAc is the most frequently used target area
for addiction, and has consistently shown promis-
ing results across human case studies and animalresearch. We, therefore, conclude that NAc DBS is
currently the most promising candidate target for
therapy-refractory addiction. Four different animalstudies using several substances showed a reduction
of different aspects of addiction-related behaviour,
while in five human case studies (16 individualstreated), a reduction or cessation of drug intake was
observed that lasted at least a year. No important side
effects were reported in any of these studies,confirming more extensive studies on the applicationof NAc DBS in other psychiatric disorders where most
adverse events were transient and generally resolved
after adjustments of stimulation parameters or weretolerated because of the beneficial effects of treat-
ment.
38For an overview of adverse events with DBS
in the ventral striatal area for the treatment of OCD ordepression the reader is referred to Supplementary
Table S1 in supplementary material.
Possible mechanisms of action of NAc DBS in the
treatment of addiction
The NAc has an established central role in reward
processing in the context of addictive behaviours—itshows both acute drug-related activity changes and
long-term alterations in structure and function on
prolonged drug use, is involved in the transition fromvoluntary to compulsory drug use and in relapse afterextinction.
15,39–42
The precise mechanisms behind DBS are still a
matter of investigation and we can only speculateabout the mechanism of action of NAc DBS in the
treatment of addiction. Here, we elaborate on two
plausible mechanisms. First, NAc stimulation couldnormalize dysfunction in striatal areas of which the
NAc is an important part. Recent studies show
reduced striatal dopamine activity in individuals withdrug addiction that might be responsible for decreased
sensitivity to natural reinforcers whereas long-lasting
drug-induced increases of dopamine are likely toactivate the reward circuits.
43This situation might
strengthen the relative salience of drugs over natural
reinforcers leading to fixed motivational choices.
Normalizing striatal functionality by DBS mightreduce craving and increase the relative salience of
natural reinforcers. Second, NAc DBS might activate
afferent and efferent pathways leading to distantsynaptic inhibitory and excitatory effects, modulating
dysfunctional neuronal network activity. For example,
electrophysiological animal studies suggest a reducedfiring in orbitofrontal cortex pyramidal cells and
enhanced synchronicity of the thalamo-cortical circuit
after high-frequency NAc DBS.
44,45The NAc is con-
nected to the prefrontal and cingulate cortices and tolimbic areas such as the amygdala, hippocampus,
thalamus and midbrain.
46Studies with addicted
individuals have shown a decreased activity in thecingulate gyrus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
presumably affecting the process of inhibitory con-
trol.
43,46Modulating neuronal activity within this
network could lead to an increase in self-control. We
must note that these mechanisms are not mutually
exclusive and could both contribute to the reportedeffects. Moreover, different brain regions and differentclasses of cells may be affected differently by high-
frequency stimulation.
47The effects of NAc DBS on
monoamine neurotransmitters in the target area and inother regions of the network were examined in two
recent animal studies.
48,49The first study suggested
that stimulation of the NAc shell can decreasedopamine and serotonin turnover (measured as the
metabolite-transmitter ratio’s in post-mortem tissue)
locally, whereas stimulation of the NAc core did not.
48
Neither core nor shell stimulation affected the turn-
over of these monoamines in the mPFC.48A recent
in vivo micro dialysis study did not detect any
alterations in dopamine, serotonin or noradrenalinerelease in the NAc core during stimulation in the
same area.
49Unpublished findings, however, show
increases in the release of all three monoamines inboth medial and orbital prefrontal cortex (A van Dijk,
personal communication). Together with the results of
McCracken and Grace,
44,45these results emphasize the
importance of distant effects. Furthermore, these
findings suggest that the mechanism of action ofReview of target areas for DBS in addiction
J Luigjes et al
579
Molecular PsychiatryNAc DBS is not dependent on one but probably on
various effects that modulate the underlying patho-
physiology in different ways.
Other potentially effective target areas
In animal studies, stimulation of the mPFC was alsoassociated with reductions in drug-seeking behaviour
or drug intake without side effects. However, to date,
only one study for this potential target region hasbeen conducted and, therefore, more preclinicalresearch is needed to confirm these findings. It is of
note that two potentially interesting target areas have
not been studied at all, neither in human nor inanimal studies: the insula and cingulate cortex. The
insula has received more attention from addiction
researchers following a publication showing thatsmokers who had a brain stroke of the insula were
over a 100 times more likely to stop smoking than
smokers who had their brain infarction in otherareas.
50Imaging studies have shown activation of
the insula during drug craving and a correlation of
reported subjective craving with insula activity.51The
insula is thought to be involved in encoding inter-oceptive effects of drug use rituals, which in turn
could have a role in craving for drugs and promoting
addiction behaviour.
51Chemical inactivation of the
insula has been shown to disrupt addictive behav-
iours in rats.52,53The cingulate cortex is another
potentially interesting area. Abnormalities in this areaare likely to have a role in disadvantageous decision
making, increasing the risk for drug use and relapse.
54
Hypoactivation of this area has been consistently
observed in addicted patients during inhibition orselective attention tasks,
54whereas hyperactivation
was observed during craving.54Furthermore, disrupt-
ing the cingulate cortex either by lesions or strokehave reduced or ceased addiction.
55,56It is of special
interest that one of the target areas for DBS in
depression is located in the cingulate region: Brod-mann area 25.
57,58Results suggest that this area might
be involved in the emotional response to drugs and
contributes to the craving for drugs.59However, no
studies are available on cingulate cortex DBS in
addiction and further preclinical research is needed.
Translational issues in DBS research
Animal studies are indispensable in uncovering the
mechanisms behind the effects of DBS and elucidat-ing neuronal circuitries underlying the disorder. Theycan also help us identify potentially safe and effective
new brain targets and new stimulation paradigms for
the treatment of patients with addictive behaviours.
60
However, translational research of DBS in addiction
has its limitations as well; animal models of addiction
do not represent the full complexity of the disorderand the practical application of DBS in rodents
is different from DBS in humans. Animal models
used in preclinical studies often do not distinguish‘recreative’ drug use from the compulsive drug takingthat characterizes addiction.
61Models that include
drug-seeking and drug taking when the animal is
faced with adverse consequences such as foot shocksshould therefore be considered.
62,63Using such a
model in DBS research might be a better predictor for
the effects of DBS in individuals with chronic
treatment-refractory drug addiction.
Another translational issue is the difference in
anatomical brain regions between rodents and hu-
mans. The anatomical subdivision of the NAc in shelland core is often made in animal (rodent) research.
Although histochemically the shell and core are also
distinguishable in humans,
64it is not known whether
there are functional similarities between animal and
human NAc shell and core. Moreover, currently the
spatial resolution in imaging techniques is notsufficient to differentiate between the core and shellin humans.
65Although the differences between shell
and core in animal research can be of conceptual
interest, it is questionable whether they are transla-tional meaningful for the targeting of DBS in humans,
because the placement of electrodes depends on these
imaging techniques.
It should also be noted that many technical aspects
of rodent DBS differ significantly from the clinical
parameters. All animal studies except for the one byLevy et al .
10use acute stimulation (restricted to the
duration of experiment), whereas all human studies
rely on chronic stimulation. Previous studies haveshown that mechanisms of acute stimulation candiffer from those of chronic stimulation.
66Further-
more, although the tips of the electrodes used in rats
can be fairly small, they are still relatively largecompared with those used in humans, specifically
when placed in brain areas that are relatively bigger in
humans than rats such as the prefrontal cortex andinsula. This could create a larger area of stimulation
with lower specificity as a possible consequence.
Moreover, animal studies often use bipolar stimula-tion, whereas in human studies monopolar stimula-tion is favoured leading to differences in stimulation
field. Finally, stimulation amplitudes have tradition-
ally been higher in animal compared with humanstudies. These differences should be taken into
account when extrapolating findings from preclinical
studies to humans.
66
Medical ethical considerations
In accordance with Carter et al .,67we would like to
emphasize that DBS for addiction can only beconsidered when the highest medical ethical stan-
dards are applied. These include careful patient
selection, responsible publishing and media report-ing, and free and non-coerced choice to be treated
with DBS. For more detailed ethical guidelines, we
refer to previous papers.
67–72In DBS for addiction,
patient selection deserves special attention because of
the serious social and physical problems that often
accompany chronic alcohol or drug dependence. Inthe screening process, patients will have to undergoReview of target areas for DBS in addiction
J Luigjes et al
580
Molecular Psychiatrycareful physical examination and laboratory testing to
determine their fitness for anaesthesia and surgery.
Furthermore, patients should be seriously motivatedand be able to keep their appointments since DBS isan intensive procedure that requires extensive follow-
up and careful observations of symptoms and possi-
ble side effects. DBS should, therefore, be restricted tochronically addicted, treatment-refractory patients
stable enough to comply with an intensive period of
treatment and research. Lastly, patients should have(had) unrestricted and free of charge access to
alternative treatments, that is, DBS has to be a free
and non-coerced choice, which is important sinceserious concerns have been expressed about some
neurosurgical lesion studies in addicted patients on
these issues.
73,74
Recommendations
Ultimately, the evidence for new DBS indicationsand targets has to come from clinical studies and,
therefore, carefully designed pilot studies are needed
as a next step for those target areas that have shownto be effective and safe in preclinical research and
clinical research in patients with other psychiatric
disorders. Based on the discussed literature, weconclude that NAc DBS was effective and safe in
animal research and has shown encouraging results in
human case reports. Moreover DBS of the NAc hasproven to be safe in the treatment of OCD anddepression
75–77(see Supplementary Table S1). There-
fore, we would like to propose that small and
carefully designed pilot DBS studies using the NAcas target area for the treatment of chronic addiction
are indicated.
However, Carter et al .
67recently reached the
opposite conclusion on the basis of largely the same
literature—minus four more recent published pa-
pers.16,18,24,25They argue that (1) there is insufficient
clinical evidence and more preclinical research has tobe conducted to identify the optimal brain target; (2)
more clinical experience has to be gained with other
psychiatric disorders to better estimate risks involvedin DBS; and (3) other effective treatments are avail-
able for addiction and addiction does not carry a high
enough probability of significant harm to justifyinvasive interventions such as DBS.
We would like to argue that (1) four studies from
four different research groups consistently foundsignificant decreases of addiction-like behaviour
following NAc DBS in rats, assessed by three different
paradigms and using three different substances (2);the described case reports support the safety andpossible efficacy of NAc DBS. Furthermore, NAc DBS
has proven to be safe and to be associated with very
few side effects in the treatment of other psychiatricdisorders;
75–77and (3) although there is a variety of
(moderately) effective interventions to treat patients
with addiction, research shows that many patients donot respond to currently available treatments even in
countries where addiction treatments are accessibleand free of charge. Additionally, high mortality rates
( > 27%) are associated with drug addiction because of
overdose, drug-associated illnesses, violence andsuicides.
78–81
In summary, the use of DBS for the treatment of
mental disorders is ground-breaking development in
psychiatry and NAc DBS may create new opportu-nities for the treatment of treatment-refractory ad-
dicted patients.

Abstract
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for neuromodulation is now commonplace. However little is known about the incidence of
either procedural related seizures or epilepsy following chronic DBS. This study aims to provide estimates of thesecomplications for movement disorders, pain and psychiatric conditions. A literature review was performed. Because searchesusing the terms seizure, epilepsy, and deep brain stimulation revealed only papers dealing with experimental and clinical
application of DBS to treat chronic seizures disorders, a search strategy trawling through papers that described clinical case
series of DBS was used. Thirty-two papers were reviewed that described stereotactic placement of DBS electrodes formovement disorders, pain syndromes and psychiatric conditions with cohorts of n 45. Sixteen of these papers describing at
least 1418 DBS electrode placements in 1254 patients did not mention seizures as a complication (i.e., it was not possible to
know whether seizures had or had not occurred). In 16 papers, describing at least 2101 electrode placements in 1555
patients, seizures were described in 42 patients (incidence 2.7%). The range of seizure incidence varied from 0% (three seriesencompassing 317 patients and 576 electrode placements) up to 10% (n ¼130) and 13% (n ¼15). The reasons for this
variance were not obvious. At least 74% of seizures occurred around the time of electrode implantation and many of these
patients also suffered intracranial hemorrhage. Follow up times were variable (range 6mths to 5 years). The analysis wascomplicated by multiple publications from some centres with duplication of some data. The quality of literature on seizuresfollowing DBS insertion for neuromodulation is highly variable. Analysis of the available data, after making corrections for
publication of duplicate data, suggests strongly that the risk of seizures associated with DBS placement is probably lower than
2.4% (95% CI 1.7 to 3.3 %). The risk of postprocedural seizures associated with chronic deep brain stimulation is even lowerwith best estimates around 0.5% (95% CI .02 to 1.0%).
Key words: Deep brain stimulation, Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, pain obsessive-compulsive disease, seizure, epilepsy.
Introduction
Functional stereotactic surgery using Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS) is now widely used for a range ofmovement disorders and pain conditions, and is
being evaluated in the treatment of some mood and
psychiatric disturbances, refractory epilepsies, Tour-ette’s syndrome, cluster headache and eating dis-orders.
1–5The spectrum of procedural and chronic
complications associated with DBS is relatively welldocumented and includes inter alia intracranial
hemorrhage, infection, hardware failure, and mooddisturbances.
6Since the procedure involves cortical
puncture and traversing subcortical brain tissue to
attain a mesodiencephalic or pallidal target one wouldexpect a certain risk of seizures and epilepsy as acomplication of the procedure. Paradoxically how-ever there is increasing experimental and clinical workon the use of DBS to treat certain refractory
epilepsies.

The aim of this study was to ascertain what is the
risk of periprocedural seizures and what is the risk ofepilepsy being caused by chronic DBS for the
common movement disorders (Parkinson’s Disease,
essential tremor, multiple sclerosis, dystonias), forcertain chronic pain conditions and obsessive com-pulsive disorder. The raison d’etre for this paperarose because of two issues contemporaneous.

experience.
Methods
An electronic literature review was performed on
PubMed using the speciﬁed search terms seizures,epilepsy, Deep Brain stimulation, Parkinson’s Dis-
ease, essential tremor, dystonia, pain, complication,
hematoma.
Searches using the terms seizure, epilepsy, and
deep brain stimulation revealed only papers dealingwith experimental and clinical application of DBS totreat chronic seizures disorders. Therefore a searchstrategy trawling through the senior author’s largedatabase of clinical papers on functional and stereo-
tactic surgery for the incidence of seizures in clinical
case series of n 45 of DBS was used. Additional
papers were searched on PubMed from referencesthat looked appropriate. Data was analysed usingnon-parametric statistics.
Results
Thirty-two papers were retrieved that described
stereotactic placement of DBS electrodes forParkinsons Disease, essential tremor, multiplesclerosis, dystonia and pain syndromes with cohortsn45 (Table I). Sixteen of these papers describing at
least 1418 DBS electrode placements in 1254patients did not mention seizures as a complication(i.e., it was not possible to know whether seizures had
or had not occurred).
In 16 papers describing at least 2099 electrode
placements in 1555 patients, seizures were describedin 42 patients (2.7%). The range of seizure incidencevaried from 0% (three series encompassing 239patients and 420 electrode placements) to as highas 10% (n ¼130) and 13% (n ¼15). However in the
2 papers where seizures occurred in relatively large
numbers of patients (10 and 8), both described data
from Lozano’s group in Toronto,
7,8so there is
almost certainly duplication of some data. If oneassumed that all 10 patients having seizures from thatcentre in Seijo’s paper
8included all from the earlier
Venkatraghagen paper,7then correction of data ( 78
patients from the seizure total, 7110 patients from
the overall patient number) suggests an incidence of
35 seizures in 1445 patients (2.4%, 95% CI 1.7–3.3).
Many of these patients who suffered periproceduralseizures also suffered from intracranial hemorrhage
8
as a complication of surgery, but many with an ICHdid not have a seizure
9(Table I).
If it is assumed that all seizures that did not have a
speciﬁed periprocedural or immediate postoperativeincidence (n ¼7) were delayed then at least 75%
(95% CI 55-89%) of seizures occurred around the
time of implantation of the electrode. The estimatedincidence of delayed seizures is therefore around0.5% (95% CI 0.02 to 1.0%).Follow-up times in the various series were variable
(range 6 months to 5 years).
Discussion
A simple electronic literature search for the incidence
of seizures or epilepsy after DBS implantation forneuromodulative purposes was not particularly useful
because of the large experimental neuroscience
literature encompassing DBS, and the use of DBSfor control of some seizure disorders. Therefore astrategy of reviewing larger series of DBS patients wasadopted and these papers searched for incidence ofseizure disorder, timing of the seizures and whetherthe seizures were associated with other surgicalcomplications such as intracranial hematoma.
Such information in many series, unfortunately,
was either absent or if present, difﬁcult to timeprecisely or relate to periprocedural complications.
8,9
There was also a large variation in the reportedincidence of seizure complications. This suggeststhat at best the ﬁgures obtained from the review areestimates. However a further paper found after initialsubmission of this report described 2 cases or
epilepsy in 86 cases (2.3%).
38This ﬁgure is identical
to that found in our literature review and suggeststhat although our report does not have the authorityof a meta-analysis the ﬁgures are as good as can bederived from current data.
Unfortunately the data gives no insight into why
the incidence of periprocedural seizures was sovariable between series. Factors that theoretically
could inﬂuence seizure occurrence such as the use of
ventriclography, microelectrodes, the amplitude,duration and frequency of macroelectrode or DBSelectrode stimulation of the awake patient whentesting for neurophysiological responses are notavailable. Indeed both from Grenoble,
10,12,15where
the use of both ventriculography and microelectroderecording is known to be extensive, and a paper
looking at speciﬁc complications of microelectrode
9
use, seizures were not mentioned as a complication.
Conversely the incidence of seizures from Lozano’sgroup in Toronto, where microelectrode use iswidespread, was high.
8
Perhaps the best-quality data was the prospective
data submitted to the FDA for regulatory purpose bythe DBS manufacturers Medtronic (Medtronic,
Minneapolis) (www.Fda.Gov/cdrh/pmajul97.html).
37
Procedural related seizures occurred in 1.2% of 424
patients (95% CI 0.5%–2.7%). There were noseizures in this data associated with chronic stimula-tion. Interestingly in the independent audit performedafter 4 years in a large number of Parkinsonianpatients having bilateral STN DBS implantation,although there were numerous adverse side effects
epilepsy or seizures were not documented.

Some of the papers covered in the review were
from the same centres but describing cases cohorts ofdifferent sizes. It is therefore possible that there is180 E. Coley et al.

some duplication of data. For example the data
(n¼117) from one paper by Benabid and collea-
gues15almost certainly covers two early papers on
the same topic.10,12The papers by Blond11and
Caparros-Lefebre13may also contain the same
patients as may those of from the Aziz’s Oxfordgroup.
25,28However in all these papers there was no
mention of seizures so the data does not contribute to
the estimates made.
Adjustments to the estimates were made in the
results because of the contribution of patients fromToronto probably being cross referred. It is alsopossible that there was also double counting of somepatients described in The European tremor trial,
23
where there were 4 cases of seizure, and theMedtronic FDA data
37where there were 5 cases.
Adjusting the data for potential double counting
within this cohort reduces the number of seizures to31 in 1308 patients. However this gives an overallseizure estimate of 2.4% with 95% CI of 1.6 to 3.3%,which is almost identical to the unadjusted estimate.
Given these caveats and shortcomings with much
of the literature, patients may be counselled pre-operatively that the seizure risk is relatively low at
around 2.5%, irrespective of the indication for the
DBS, that it is largely periprocedural, and that thelikelihood of a chronic seizure disorder occurring isextremely low at around 0.5%. Additionally patientsshould be able to resume driving once they haverecovered from their DBS surgery, unless there areother contra-indications to driving.

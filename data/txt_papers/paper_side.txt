Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly investigated as a therapy for psychiatric disorders. In the ethical evaluation of this novel approach, incidence and impact
of side effects (SE) play a key role. In our contribution, we analyze the discussion on SE of DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN)—a standard therapy for movement
disorders like Parkinson’s disease (PD)—based on 66 case reports, 69 review papers, and 347 outcome studies from 1993 to 2009. We show how the DBS commu nity
increasingly acknowledged the complexity of STN-DBS side effects. Then we discuss the issue of study quality and the methods used to assess SE. We note that some
side effects are the subject of conﬂicting evaluations by the different stakeholders involved. This complicates the ethical controversy inherent i n any novel treatments for
diseases that involve psychiatric aspects. We delineate how the lessons from STN-DBS could guide future DBS applications in the ﬁeld of psychiatry.

Since the advent of medicine, the maxim “do not harm your
patient” forms the core of the ethos for physicians. This is
reﬂected in the principle of nonmaleﬁcience as one of the
four principles of biomedical ethics (Beauchamp and Chil-dress 2009). Nevertheless, it is broadly acknowledged that
harmful side effects (SE) of therapies have to be weighed
up against their beneﬁcial effects. The deliberation of harmsand beneﬁts becomes more difﬁcult if side effects of novel
therapeutic approaches have to be considered, of which the
nature, extent, and incidence are not yet known.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an example for a novel
therapeutic approach. Its roots go back to the early 1950s
(Hariz et al. 2010), and it emerged in its current form inthe 1980s as an alternative for ablative surgery in move-
ment disorders and an experimental therapy in chronic pain
(Siegfried and Blons 1997). DBS became an established ther-apy for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other movement dis-
orders in the last decade (Benabid et al. 2009). Side effects
have been discussed since the advent of DBS, but the sen-sibility for them and the appreciation of their complexity is
increasing. This also reﬂects the maturation of the therapy.
The term “side effect” does not provide per se an ethical
orientation how to deal with a speciﬁc therapy. Therefore,

christen@ethik.uzh.chterms like “adverse events” or “sequelae” (adverse events
that count as long-term negative consequences) should be
avoided as long as the negative evaluation of the side effect
is not clear. For assessing particular side effects, they canbe classiﬁed along the two dimensions predictability and
evaluation (Table 1).
As Table 1 shows, only one type of side effects (pre-
dictable and clearly outweighing the beneﬁts) bears the
clear “ethical message” that the therapy should not be ap-
plied or that research on this therapy should be stopped.Thus, the determination of what counts as an adverse event
involves both a measurement problem and an evaluation
problem, which can be entangled in the process of devel-oping the therapy (M ¨uller and Christen 2011). DBS for PD
patients is a paradigmatic example for outlining that prob-
lem, since ﬁrst, the predictability of side effects for individ-ual patients is difﬁcult; second, the evaluation of some side
effects differs signiﬁcantly between patients, their relatives,
and physicians (M ¨uller and Christen 2011); and third, both
the disease (Kulisevsky et al. 2008) and alternative thera-
peutic approaches (medication or surgery; see Voon et al.
2006 and Olanow 2002) may involve effects similar to thoseof DBS.

The following investigation is based on a comprehen-
sive analysis of the research literature on DBS in the nucleus
subthalamicus (STN), currently the preferred target for DBS
in PD. This analysis covers 66 case reports, 69 review papers,and 347 outcome studies from 1993 to 2009 that emerged
from an extensive search in the following databases: CPCI-S,
Embase, Francis, Medline, PsychINFO, and SCI-expanded(the reference lists are available as supporting online mate-
rial).
As the STN is part of various thalamo-cortical circuits
(Marani et al. 2008), the relatively high incidence of cog-
nitive and affective side effects after STN DBS comparedto other DBS targets is not surprising (Hariz et al. 2008).
The way the DBS community dealt with this issue is thus a
paradigmatic case for analyzing SE measurement and eval-uation in the course of the establishment of novel therapies.
Understanding this process may support the ethical analysis
of the current application of DBS to a variety of psychiatricdisorders (for an overview about psychiatric DBS, see Krack
et al. 2010).
THE COMPLEXITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS
Since the early 1990s, the STN has been investigated as a
potential DBS target both in animal and clinical studies. In
1993, the ﬁrst case was published in a French journal (Pollaket al. 1993). Several case reports and outcome studies fol-
lowed, and since the late 1990s the number of publications
on STN-DBS has increased steadily (M ¨uller and Christen
2011). The number of STN-DBS-related issues discussed in
the literature has grown rapidly, whereas a bibliometric in-
vestigation demonstrated that case reports spearhead thetransdisciplinary communication about DBS (Christen and
M¨uller 2011).
To handle the complexity of issues that are discussed in
our literature body of 482 STN-DBS publications, we have
sorted them into 18 issue classes (Table 2). For each class,
we have evaluated all tests used in the outcome literature tomeasure the respective phenomena and the wording used
to describe the corresponding SE. Note that not every is-
sue class is directly related to SE. This is true especially forstudies on the neuronal basis of DBS effects (usually in-vestigated by PET) or about the cost-effectiveness of DBS.
Furthermore, the boundaries between some issue classes
are less clear and require predeﬁnitions. For example, we
have classiﬁed studies about language ﬂuency as “cogni-tive” (in accordance with the current neuropsychological
understanding).
Each publication (case report, review, outcome study)
was attributed to one or several issue classes with regard
to the topics discussed and the methods used. Thereby we
did not take into account possible causal relations between
certain issues. For example, many issues have an impact on
the quality of life (Q). Nevertheless, a study whose primaryfocus, for example, was insomnia was only classiﬁed as “I,”
not as “Q.” For analyzing the time course of the publication
praxis, it was necessary to build bigger groups. Therefore,we have grouped the 18 issue classes into four groups as
follows:
1. Group: Understanding therapeutic effects: F, M, V.
2. Group: Medical and technical intervention issues: O, P,
T.
3. Group: Main affective, behavioral and cognitive side ef-
f e c t so fD B S :B ,C ,D ,L ,Q .
4 . G r o u p :O t h e ri s s u e s :A ,E ,I ,K ,N ,S ,W .
The histogram in Figure 1 shows the time course of the
different groups of issues in the DBS literature. The absolutenumbers of publications per year belonging to one of the
four issue groups are displayed for the years 1993 to 2009.
The analysis reveals that—after the ﬁrst, pioneering yearswith very few studies—issues on main affective, behavioral,
and cognitive side effects quickly appeared in the literature
and have been the dominant group since 2003. This ﬁnd-ing is corroborated by an analysis of DBS posters presented
at conferences (Christen and M ¨uller 2011). Although one
has to take into account that this analysis is not sensiblefor the valuation of these effects (i.e. whether they are con-
sidered to be unproblematic or not), this ﬁnding somehow
contrasts with several statements in the literature, such thatthe DBS community would often ignore the neurobehav-
ioral consequences of the therapy (e.g., Burn and Tr ¨oster
2004).

QUALITY OF STN-DBS STUDIES
The sensibility for new side effects in the process of matura-
tion of a novel therapy is a critical issue—and we may say
that the DBS community has passed this test successfully.Another issue is the quality of the studies. Although it is well
known that novel therapies start with isolated case stud-
ies that usually lack quality criteria like randomization orblinding, at some point the urge for better studies is raised.
DBS did not deviate from this development path, and vari-
ous authors have discussed the issue of study quality (e.g.,Woods et al. 2006) and proposed standards for improving
study quality (e.g., Morrison et al. 2000). We investigated
the study quality for all outcome studies that involved atleast one issue of group 3 (i.e., B, C, D, L, or Q). For that,we expanded the criteria for level of evidence assignment
proposed by Martinez-Martin and Deuschl (2007) using a
rating system that involves several aspects being consid-
ered as relevant for study quality (e.g., regarding follow-uptime) by the DBS community.

Figure 1. The histogram displays the total number of issues (compare with Table 2) addressed in the publications
about STN-DBS (case reports, reviews, and outcome studies) pooled in four groups (group 1: F, M, V; group 2: O, P , T;g r o u p3 :B ,C ,D ,L ,Q ;g r o u p4 :A ,E ,I ,K ,N ,S ,W ;s e et e x t ) .
As Figure 2a demonstrates, the quality range of the stud-
ies is broad. Somewhat surprising is the fact that the meanquality of the outcome studies has not increased signiﬁ-
cantly since 2000 (Figure 2b; earlier studies were not taken
into account due to their low numbers). Although the ab-solute number of high-quality studies of group 3 has in-
creased, this is shrouded by the also increasing number of
outcome studies of poor quality.
This absent increase of the average study quality is not
per se problematic, as long as the community is able to dif-
fer between good and poor studies. To investigate whetherthis is the case, we calculated a citation coefﬁcient based on
DBS review papers about the outcome studies of group 3.
2
Then we performed a correlation analysis of the relation-
ship of this citation coefﬁcient and the quality rating for
each study. The result is a (weak) positive correlation of the
citation coefﬁcient with the quality rating (Pearson’s corre-
lation coefﬁcient: 0.29). That means that high-quality papers
tend to be cited more often in the reviews. This can be in-terpreted as a hint for a higher appreciation of high-quality
studies of group 3 by the DBS community.
time of at least 12 months: +1; the study involved tests of at least
three issue classes: +1.
2. The citation coefﬁcient was construed as follows: We countedthe appearance of outcome studies in the analytic part of reviewsthat either performed a meta-analysis following established stan-dards (e.g., Cochrane) or were at least systematically evaluated(i.e., we excluded merely narrative reviews; thus, we considered23 reviews). The citation of outcome papers is weighted with theprobability of being able to be cited due to the year of publication totake into account, such that a paper, e.g., published in 2006 cannotbe cited in a review published in 2004. Thus, each outcome paperreceived a citation coefﬁcient value between 0 and 1. For the cor-relation analysis, only outcomes with nonzero citation coefﬁcienthave been analyzed.MEASURING ADVERSE EVENTS
After analyzing the attention for side effects of group 3 and
the quality of the studies investigating them, we investi-
gated a third issue: To what extent do the studies capture
“relevant” side effects, i.e. those reﬂecting serious ethicalissues (see Table 1)? This point requires a closer look to the
methods and tests used in the outcome studies. We listed all
tests used in the 347 outcome studies and attributed themto one of the 18 issue groups. By far most of the tests were
assigned to one of the ﬁve issue classes B, C, D, L, and Q
(group 3), whereas the internal distribution is very uneven.Figure 3a demonstrates that more than half of all methods
applied are tests regarding cognitive issues. Also, the num-
ber of uses of the tests themselves is remarkably uneven.Very few tests are used regularly. Furthermore, the proba-
bility that a test is used in a study for neuropsychological
outcome assessment does not correspond completely to thefour standards proposed in the literature (Defer et al. 1999;
Morrison et al. 2000; Pillon 2002; Saint-Cyr et al. 2000). For
example, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and the OddMan Out Test, both recommended in all four standards, are
comparably rarely used. This may indicate a learning effect
by the community, as tests better than the ones initially rec-ommended are available that measure similar constructs.
For the ethical evaluation it is of particular interest
which perspectives are represented in the tests, as conﬂict-
ing evaluations of side effects often result from different
perspectives of stakeholders. For analyzing this point, wehave classiﬁed all tests as follows:
I. Test scores that result from the evaluation of the pa-
tient’s performance by a trained evaluator.
II. Test scores that result from a self-assessment of the pa-
tient.

 Abstract 
This study charts the evolution of the scientific l iterature on Parkinson’s disease (PD) from 
1983-2017 to inform communities of scientists, phys icians, patients, caregivers and 
politicians concerned with PD. Articles published i n journals indexed in the Science Citation 
Index-Expanded  database of the Web of Science  were retrieved and analyzed in seven five-
year periods: 1983-1987, 1988-1992, 1993-1997, 1998 -2002, 2003-2007, 2008-2012 and 
2013-2017. Over 35 years the number of research pap ers on PD increased 33-fold: 885 
papers in 1983-1987 to 29,972 in 2013-2017. At the same time the number of countries 
contributing to PD research increased from 37 to 13 1. The USA was the most prolific 
country throughout, followed by several European (U K, Germany, Italy and France) and 
English-speaking (Canada and Australia) countries. By 2003, several Asian countries 
(China, South Korea, India and Turkey) emerged with  rapid increases in publications related 
to PD. By 2013-2017, China surpassed all but the US A to rank 2nd globally in productivity. 
Despite an increase from 4 to 22 African countries publishing PD research from 1983-2017, 
most were either unproductive or contributed ≤ 5 papers in each five-year period. There has 
also been a 12-fold increase in the number of journ als (232 to 2,824) containing papers on 
PD. In 2013-2017 three PD-focused journals ( Parkinsonism & Related Disorders , 
Movement Disorders  and Journal of Parkinson’s Disease ) contained 6.8% of all PD papers 
while a large majority (82.5%) of journals publishe d ≤ 10 papers. This quantitative study 
complements the numerous extant qualitative reviews  to provide a global perspective on PD 
research.

 1. Introduction 
 During the last two decades, the scientific publis hing activity on Parkinson’s disease (PD) 
increased tremendously, well beyond that of the glo bal scientific literature (Fig. 1). This literature  
growth accompanies the important scientific progres s made in PD, along with the growing interest 
among researchers and clinicians. PD is now the wor ld’s second most common neurodegenerative 
disorder, affecting more than six million people wo rldwide. The 2016 global health metrics show 
that Parkinson’s disease contributes 3.2 million di sability-adjusted life-years (DALY) and is 
responsible for 706 thousand YLD, years lived with disability [1,2]. Based on the two metrics, PD 
ranked 6th among neurologic disorders. On the occas ion of the 200th anniversary of Shaking Palsy, 
a comprehensive review paper on the past, present, and future of Parkinson’s disease prepared by 
over three dozen prominent researchers was publishe d recently [3].   
In the past decade, several studies have tried to q uantify various aspects of the PD scientific 
literature, for example: citation analysis of eithe r highly-cited PD papers [4-5] or highly-cited PD 
research authors [6]; bibliometric profile of deep brain stimulation [7]; bibliometric impact of 
neurosurgical research [8,9]; highly-cited works in  essential tremor and dystonia [10,11]; 
bibliometric analysis of movement disorder [12]; bi bliometric analysis of stem cell transplantation 
[13]; and bibliometric study of neuroscience resear ch from 2006 to 2015 [14].  
A global bibliometric analysis of the PD field from  1991-2006 showed increasing 
international collaboration among researchers and d emonstrated that author-provided keyword 
analysis was a novel approach to research trends in  PD [15]. Gupta and Bala [16] provide India’s 
research output of PD papers for 10 years (2002-201 1) and note that there are no other PD scientific 
literature studies which focusses on specific count ries or regions.  
To enhance the extant body of research briefly ment ioned above, we studied the evolution of 
the PD scientific literature over the last 35 years  (1983-2017). Our investigation focuses on the 
geographical distribution of the PD research activi ty, and on the scientific journals publishing PD MANUSCRIPT

 research. We reviewed publications from 1983-2017 g rouped in five-year periods: 1983-1987, 
1988-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2002, 2003-2007, 2008-20 12 and 2013-2017.    MANUSCRIPT

 2. Material and Methods 
The data were collected in August 2018 from the Science Citation Index-Expanded  (SCI-E) 
of the Web of Science  (WoS). Publications dated from 1983-2017 were cons idered for analyses 
based on the following criteria: 
• All publications designated as ‘articles’; containi ng Parkinson* in their titles, abstracts or 
keywords where the asterisk retrieves ‘Parkinson’ a nd all extended variants; but excluding 
publications on ‘Wolff-Parkinson-White’. 
Articles retrieved were then analysed in seven five -year periods from 1983-1987 to 2013-
2017 and the following parameters were considered: 
• The number of articles authored by researchers in e ach country – articles issued from more 
than one country were assigned equally to each cont ributing country. 
• The top-10 most prolific journals. 
Impact Factors (IFs) for 2017 were collected throug h the Thomson Scientific Journal 
Citation Reports . Articles originating from England, Scotland, Wale s and Northern Ireland were 
assigned to the United Kingdom (UK), and the Europe an Union (EU) were the official member 
States (Countries) registered during each of the se ven five-year periods.

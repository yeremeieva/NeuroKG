Review research ABSTRACT  
Abstract: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the preventive role of physical activity in depression, 
and relevant research is rapidly on the rise. The aim of this study was to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the 50 
most-cited review papers on physical activity and depression, thus identifying important research topics and 
future research directions. 
Methods: The 50 most-cited review articles were identified and extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection 
database (on 31st October 2022), and a bibliometric citation analysis was performed using the Microsoft Excel 
and VOSviewer software (Version 1.6.18). Information on the country, authors of publications, publishing 
journals, citations (i.e., total or annual), keywords, and other meaningful data was analysed comprehensively. 
Results: The 50 most-cited review articles received, on average, 247.5 citations per article. Most review articles 
were from England, with contributions from some highly cited researchers and research teams. Western coun-
tries/regions, such as England, Australia, and the USA were the most influential in publishing review articles on 
physical activity and depression. The Journal of Affective Disorders and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
were the journals that published the most highly cited review articles on physical activity and depression. 
Important research topics on the literature on physical activity and depression focused on (1) different types of 
physical activity and depression; (2) intervention studies related to physical activity and depression; (3) fitness 
and physical activity levels in people with depression; (4) methodological analyses in physical activity and 
depression studies; and (5) the impact of physical activity on depression in different populations. 
Conclusion: This study reveals that review studies on physical activity and depression have great potential to 
develop further knowledge. This study also highlights some future research directions, which can serve to 
effectively advance the knowledge base.   
1.Introduction 
An individual with depression may experience symptoms such as 
mood issues, loss of interest or pleasure, a lack of energy, feelings of guilt 
or low self-esteem, disturbed sleep or appetite, and difficulty concen -
trating [1]. There is a higher risk of disease associated with depression, 
which adversely affects human health and well-being [1]. It has been 
well-documented that depressive symptoms have a detrimental impact 
on psychological and physical health from infancy through to old age [2, 
3]. For example, depression in childhood has a long lasting negative 
effect on mental health later in life [4], and can lead to neurological 
abnormalities in the aging population [3]. Specifically, the detrimental 
health outcomes of high levels of depression include diabetes [5], cardiovascular disease [6], cancer [7], and other health problems [8]. 
Furthermore, depression is an important predictor of cardiac mortality 
and morbidity, such as cardiac functioning and coronary heart disease 
[9]. Depression also affects biological factors and, consequently, con-
tributes to physical disability [10]. 
The high prevalence of depression has been established in the 
existing evidence. According to the World Health Organisation, the 
prevalence of depression is increasing globally, and 4.4% of the world ’s 
population was predicted to suffer from depression in 2015 [11]. A 
systematic review synthesised 14,866 non-duplicate articles, and an 
estimated 19.1% pooled prevalence of depression was observed in 
children, adolescents, and young adults [12]. Further, the weighted 
mean prevalence of depression was 30.6% in university students [13],

2while the prevalence ranged from 0.9% to 49% in the aging population 
[14]. Notably, evidence from a scoping review has shown that 20% of 
the participants suffered from depression during the COVID-19 
pandemic [15]. The potential factors leading to the increasing preva -
lence of depression are mainly due to the environmental changes, 
including high prevalence of obesity, unhealthy diet, insufficient phys-
ical activity, and inappropriate light and lack of sleep [16]. To reverse 
the situation on the large number of patients suffering from depression 
or a group of people at the risk of developing depression, clinical prac-
tice or evidence-based recommendations strongly suggest that doing 
more physical activity (PA) can provide a feasible and effective 
approach against depression [17–21]. There has been a great amount of 
literature examining the relationship between PA and depression [17, 
18,22,23], especially review studies [24–26]. This is because review 
studies can not only summarise in-depth research knowledge, but also 
allow for the determination of future research directions. This type of 
study design has, thus, become increasingly popular, and more re-
searchers have studied PA and depression using reviews [27–31]. 
Additionally, considering some unknown research issues in the context 
of PA and depression, more research in this field is required. The use of 
the bibliometric analyses serves as a useful analytical approach to 
comprehensively summarise the current state of review studies on PA 
and depression is [32]. 
Bibliometric analysis is centred on the citations of publications [32]; 
referring to the number of research articles that cite a given published 
article [33,34]. The total number of citations not only establishes the 
academic impact of a specific article in the field, but also serves as a basis 
for determining a journal ’s impact factor, which can then be used as an 
indicator for assessing its quality [33,35,36]. Across the vast majority of 
research fields, a research article with more than 100 citations can be 
considered a high-quality paper [37,38]. On the basis of citation ana-
lyses, many studies have attempted to conduct bibliometric analyses to 
better understand recent scientific progress and research trends in a 
particular subject area [32,39,40]. 
Given that the publications concerning PA and depression in the 
literature are evolving rapidly, the relevant research scope and charac -
teristics are worth studying. Therefore, the main objective of this study 
was to identify the 50 most-cited review articles focusing on PA and 
depression, using a citation analysis. The second aim of this study was to 
visualise the most active countries/nations, author groups, and most 
frequent keywords using the VOSviewer software. This kind of analysis 
can help to deepen our understanding of the current state of research on 
PA and depression and is expected to offer novel insights into future 
research. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Search strategy 
The Web of Science Core Collection database was selected as our 
literature search source, as this database consists of more than 20,000 
peer-reviewed, high-quality journals, due to which it has been widely 
utilized for bibliometric analyses. The Web of Science Core Collection 
database provides information on author(s), countries, and keyword on 
each publication, which served as the foundation for current biblio -
metric analysis. This kind of literature search approach has been rec-
ommended by other similar studies. The search strategy was as follows: 
“physical activity ” OR “sport ” OR “exercise ” AND (depressi*). The data 
extracted from the database were exported as a “Tab-delimited ” file. 
Language limitation and publication type were specified as English and 
review, respectively. The flow chart of the study selection process is 
displayed in Fig. 1. 
2.2. Publication selection and data extraction 
All the publications (n 2310) retrieved from literature search were screened for study selection. First, the document type was restricted to 
“article ” from the 2310 publications initially retrieved, and then the 
titles and abstracts of each article were independently reviewed by two 
authors, in order to ensure that they were relevant to physical activity. 
Then, the 50 most-cited articles were selected for bibliometric analysis, 
based on the citation number, sorting with 50 as the cut-off value. The 
50 most-cited review articles were analysed by extracting the following 
information systematically: (1) publication author(s); (2) publication 
year; (3) journal; (4) total citations per review article; and (5) journal 
impact factor. 
2.3. Visualization 
The Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer (version 1.6.15) software were 
used to analyze the information from the included review articles. 
General information processing was performed using Microsoft Excel. A 
unimodal network with a focus on the visualization of academic 
knowledge was constructed using VOSviewer — a software specifically 
designed for performing bibliometric analyses on data imported from 
bibliographic databases. Author and country collaborations were visu-
alized through co-authorship analysis, while detecting research hotspots 
required analyzing co-occurrence of keywords. 
2.4. Statistical analysis 
All the statistical procedures for this study were performed using the 
Microsoft Excel, and descriptive results were presented as mean or 
range. 
3.Results 
Table 1 lists the information on the review articles included in the 
bibliometric analysis. As for the citations of included review articles, the 
range was from 89 to 756 (until the date of literature search). The 
publication year ranged between 1989 and 2019. The mean number of 
citations for all the included review articles was 247.5 citations per 
paper. More details are provided in Table 1. 
Fig. 2 depicts the network map for research collaborations between 
the countries/regions that published the 50 most-cited review articles, 
of which five clusters of countries/regions can be found. The figure in-
dicates that some western countries/regions, such as the USA, England, 
and Australia were predominant over other countries. England, 
Australia, and Brazil were the top three countries/regions that published 
top-cited review articles in the research field of PA and depression. In

Sweden and Germany were observed. Meanwhile, other collaborations 
that were not as close and strong existed, such as that between the USA 
and Chinese Taiwan. 
In terms of author collaboration, the visualization analysis demonstrated that the authors of the included review articles could be 
divided into three clusters, marking a group of certain research in-
vestigators and their collaborating researchers (see Fig. 3), such as 
Brendon Stubbs and Simon Rosenbaum. A strong and close collaboration 
was found among various authors, including those of Simon Rosenbaum, Table 1 (continued )

When looking at the keyword co-occurrence analysis for the review articles included in this study (see Fig. 4), it was observed that, in the 
research on PA and depression, important research areas include the 
types of PA (e.g., overall physical activity, exercise, aerobic physical 
activity), health outcomes (e.g., fitness), study design (e.g., randomized

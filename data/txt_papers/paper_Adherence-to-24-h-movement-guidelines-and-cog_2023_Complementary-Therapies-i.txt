Background: Studies have identified sleep, screen time, and physical activity as independent risk factors for 
cognitive impairment in adolescents. However, little is known about how these factors interact to contribute to 
cognitive difficulties. This study aimed to investigate the association between 24-h movement guidelines and 
cognitive difficulties in adolescents. 
Methods: Data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance was used for analysis. Participants self-reported 
their screen time, sleep, and physical activity levels, and cognitive difficulty was assessed using a standardized 
protocol with a binary response (Yes or No). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association 
between 24-h movement behaviours and cognitive difficulty, with results reported as the odds ratio (OR) with a 
95% confidence interval (CI). 
Results: After controlling for covariates (e.g., sex, age), compared to adolescents not adhering to none of the 24-h 
movement guidelines, adhering to the screen time (OR 1.68, 95%CI: 1.37 –2.05) and sleep guidelines (OR 
1.32, 95%CI: 1.08 –1.61) were more likely to report no cognitive difficulties in adolescents, respectively. 
Adhering to all the 24-h movement guidelines was also likely to increase the odds of reporting no cognitive 
difficulties (OR 3.38, 95%: 2.15 –5.30). 
Conclusions: The study findings suggest that promoting better 24-h movement behaviours could be an effective 
approach to reducing cognitive difficulties in adolescents. Future studies should use improved study designs to 
confirm or refute these results.   
1.Introduction 
Minor lapses in attention, memory, and psychomotor coordination 
are frequently observed in individuals who experience daily cognitive 
challenges and failures. Examples of such lapses may include stuttering, 
forgetting appointments, or missing traffic signs. It is important to note 
that cognitive failure is usually the result of temporary and remediable 
errors, rather than a general cognitive or psychomotor deficiency [1,2]. 
There is a dearth of studies on cognitive problems, which may have a 
negative effect on the quality of life [3,4]. According to the recent study 
findings, participants had more difficulty coping with cognitive chal-
lenges on a daily basis, more worry over cognitive symptoms, and an 
increase in cognitive symptoms during the previous five years [4]. 
Additionally, it was found that subjects were more prone to commit 
cognitive errors when they were female [4], younger [3], fatigued [3,4], 
depressed [4] or showing signs of small-fiber neuropathy [4]. Learning difficulties in kids are frequently associated with working memory and 
attention deficits [5–7]. Children and teenagers who struggle with 
learning and reading, in particular, frequently experience a wide range 
of social and emotional difficulties, including low self-esteem [8]. These 
issues may have caused the children to visit their paediatricians. most 
studies on cognitive challenges include adults or particular populations. 
However, because of the rapid cognitive development that occurs in 
adolescence [9], assessing the degree of cognitive issues now may assist 
in avoiding more severe ones in later life. Additionally, it is crucial to 
investigate the correlates of teenagers ’ cognitive impairments in this 
group. 
Shifts in research insights into daily movement behaviours are part of 
a paradigm shift, the Canadian 24-h movement guidelines for children 
and youth (at least 1 h of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per 
week, and ≼2 h of recreational screen time per week; 9–11 h of 
continuous sleep per night for people in the age range of 5–13, 8–10 h of

2continuous sleep per night for people in the age range of 14–17) made 
the 24-h guidelines on physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep 
[10]. According to research, 24-h movement guidelines are related to 
better health outcomes when adhered to. Meeting 24-h movement 
guidelines during childhood and adolescence is associated with 
favourable physiological [11,12] and psychological outcomes [13]. All 
three recommendations can lead to better cognitive function [14], 
weaker impulsivity [15], lower obesity probability [16], healthier di-
etary patterns [17], enhanced life quality [18], reduced risk of depres -
sion [19–21], and improved cardiometabolic, social, and emotional 
health [11,13,22] students who do not meet any of the recommenda -
tions. There was a significant reduction in medical visits related to 
mental illness among those who met 7 to 9 lifestyle recommendations 
found in a cohort study [23]. Previous studies have examined each 
movement behaviour ’s relationship with academic performance sepa-
rately. Separate studies have investigated the relationship of movement 
behaviours with academic performance [24]. We are unaware of any 
research linking physical activity, screen time, and sleep to adolescents ’ 
cognitive difficulties. There is no evidence that meeting some or all of 
the guideline recommendations is relevant to adolescents ’ cognitive 
difficulties. Above understanding contributes to the improvement of the 
adolescent cognition. 
Children and adolescents adhered to 24-h movement guidelines at 
different levels, according to several studies [18,22,25]. All three rec-
ommendations are met without gender differences among adolescents 
[22]. Boys showed a larger likelihood to satisfy the physical activity 
recommendation compared with girls. The screen time recommendation 
is more likely to be met by females than by males [22]. Considering the 
gender differences in cognitive difficulty in adolescence, it is possible 
that 24-h movement behaviours are associated with cognitive diffi-
culties in different grades, and between boys and girls. 
The goal of this study was to investigate the association between 
adolescents ’ cognitive difficulty and 24-h movement guidelines 
compliance using data from the youth risk behaviour survey (YRBS). We 
hypothesize that higher adherence to 24-h movement guidelines would 
be associated with decreased cognitive difficulties in adolescents. 
2.Methods 
2.1. YRBS design and participants 
This study utilized data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey 
(YRBS), a nationally representative survey that tracks various key health 
behaviors among high school students. These behaviors include physical 
activity, diet, alcohol use, violence, and sexual behaviors, among others. 
A three-stage sampling design was used to select a random sample of 
public and private schools in the United States to participate in the 
study. The YRBS utilized a computer-scannable questionnaire booklet 
that took approximately 45 min to complete. Most questions were 
answered in the form of single-choice questions. The survey questions 
have been shown to have good reliability [25]. The 2019 YRBS involved 
13,872 questionnaires administered in 136 schools. After conducting 
quality control, 13,677 questionnaires were deemed usable for analysis. 
The school response rate, student response rate, and overall response 
rate were 75.1%, 80.3%, and 60.3%, respectively. 
2.2. Independent variables 
2.2.1. Physical activity 
To measure physical activity, participants were asked to indicate the 
number of days in the past seven days that they engaged in physical 
activity for at least 60 min, including any activity that increased their 
heart rate and caused breathing difficulties. This single item was used to 
assess physical activity levels, and the response options ranged from 0 to 
7 days [25]. According to the 24-h movement guidelines and consistent 
with previous studies, participants who reported engaging in physical activity for all 7 days were considered to have met the physical activity 
recommendation [26]. 
2.2.2. Screen time 
Screen time was evaluated by asking participants about their daily 
television (TV) watching habits using the question, “How many hours do 
you typically spend watching TV on a regular school day? ” Response 
options included “I do not watch TV”, “less than 1 h per day”, “1 h per 
day”, “2 h per day”, “3 h per day”, “4 h per day”, and “5 or more hours 
per day. ” In line with the 24-h movement guidelines, participants who 
reported watching TV for 2 h or less per day were considered to have met 
the screen time recommendation [27,28]. 
2.2.3. Sleep duration 
The following question assessed sleep duration, that is “How many 
hours do you sleep on average on a normal school night? ”, which has 
been widely applied to measure sleep duration in adolescents [25,29]. 
Participants were provided with response options ranging from “4 or less 
hours ” to “10 or more hours ” to indicate their typical sleep duration. 
According to the 24-h movement guidelines, participants aged 5–13 who 
reported sleeping for 9–11 h per night, or participants aged 14–17 who 
reported sleeping for 8–10 h per night, were considered to have met the 
sleep duration recommendation [26]. 
2.3. Outcome variable: cognitive difficulty 
Cognitive difficulty was evaluated by the question, that is “Affected 
by physical, mental, or emotional problem, do you suffer difficulty in 
concentrating, remembering, or making decisions? ” Participants could 
answer as ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ [30]. Participants affirmatively answering ‘yes’ 
were considered as cognitively difficulty. 
2.4. Covariates 
Covariates including age, sex, grade, race/ethnicity, body mass index 
were included in this study. Information on the covariates was collected 
using a self-reported questionnaire. 
2.5. Statistical analysis 
We used SPSS 26.0 to conduct statistical analyses, which were per-
formed on a nationally representative sample, taking into account the 
complex sampling design according to the YRBSS data analysis protocol. 
To ensure that our results were nationally representative, we excluded 
all cases with missing data and those out of the age range of 14–17 years 
old, rather than using imputation methods, as the amount of missing 
data was minimal. A total of 6032 study participants were included for 
analysis. Descriptive statistics in the form of percentages were used to 
summarize the categorical variables in our sample, and a 95% confi -
dence interval was provided for the weighted estimates of the variables. 
To assess adherence to the guidelines, valid cases were grouped into one 
of four categories: no adherence, adherence to one guideline, adherence 
to two guidelines, and adherence to all three guidelines. Using binary 
logistic regression and adjusting for covariates such as ethnic group, 
grade, age, and sex, we compared participants who reported experi -
encing cognitive difficulty to the reference group. All odds ratios (ORs) 
were tested for statistical significance, with a two-sided p-value of D0.05 
and a 95% confidence interval (CI). 
3.Results 
Table 1 provides information on the characteristics of the sample. Of 
the study participants, approximately 50.4% were female. The largest 
proportion of participants were in the 9th grade (30.5%), while the 
smallest proportion were in 12th grade (12.7%). White participants 
accounted for 54.0% of the sample, which was the highest proportion Y. Lu and M.

3compared to other racial groups. The average body mass index (BMI) 
was 23.6 ±5.3 kg/m2. Overall, only 2.9% of the sample met all of the 
24-h movement guidelines. Compliance with each of the guidelines, 
including physical activity (PA), screen time (ST), and sleep, was 11%, 
16.1%, and 10.9%, respectively. Approximately 37.3% of the partici -
pants were considered to have cognitive difficulties. 
Tables 2 and 3 display the results of logistic regression analyses 
examining the association between adherence to the 24-h movement 
guidelines (in insolation and in its different combinations) and cognitive 
difficulties. After controlling for the covariates (i.e., age, sex, grade, 
race/ethnicity and body mass index.), compared to not adhering to any 
of the 24-h movement guidelines, meeting one or more of the guidelines 
in insolation except for physical activity guidelines was significantly 
associated with higher odds of being classified as having no cognitive 
difficulties. Specifically, compared to meeting none, meeting either the 
sleep (OR 1.68, 95%CI: 1.37 –2.05) or screen time (OR 1.32, 95%CI: 
1.08 –1.61) guidelines was associated with higher odds of being classi -
fied as having no cognitive difficulties. Meeting any two of the guidelines was associated with from 1.69 to 2.48 times greater odds of 
being classified as having no cognitive difficulties. Finally, meeting all of 
the 24-h movement guidelines was most strongly associated with having 
no cognitive difficulties (OR 3.38, 95%CI: 2.15 –5.30). 
4.Discussion 
Using a large representative sample of adolescents in the US, this 
study examined the association between 24-h movement guidelines and 
cognitive difficulties. We found that adolescents who met the screen 
time and sleep guidelines were significantly likely not to have cognitive 
difficulties, but these significant associations were not observed when 
examining them between physical activity guidelines and cognitive 
difficulties. Furthermore, meeting the 24-h movement guidelines 
showed a significantly lower risk for developing cognitive difficulties. 
4.1. Sleep and cognitive difficulty 
In our study, adolescents who met the sleep guidelines had signifi -
cantly higher odds of reporting no cognitive difficulties. For almost a 
century, researchers have been exploring the relationship between sleep 
and memory and learning. Numerous studies have demonstrated that 
sleep plays a critical role in the process of memory formation [31]. A 
number of review studies have summarized strong evidence that ado-
lescents ’ learning ability can be enhanced followed by an episode of 
sleep rather than wakefulness [32], implying the importance of suffi-
cient sleep on reducing risk of cognitive difficulties. Sleep significantly 
enhances the strength of memory for learned material. A growing body 
of research indicates that sleep deprivation has a negative impact on 
adolescents ’ educational outcomes. However, studies have shown that 
adolescents attending schools with later first-bell times have experi -
enced improvements in several important areas [33]. The cognitive 
functioning of adolescents is often measured in the context of school 
performance, including academic performance and mood. A short night 
sleep also negatively affects school performance [34]. As summarized in 
prior studies, sleep ’s role in stabilizing learning is sequential as full night 
of sleep is crucial to performance gains [31]. 
4.2. Screen time and cognitive difficulty 
Studies found that adolescents who reported meeting screen time 
guideline had significantly elevated odds of having no cognitive diffi-
culties. Some evidence suggests that if children and adolescents spent 
too much time in using screen-based devise, their cognitive abilities (i.e., 
attention, memory, etc.) would be diminished [35]. In the literature, 
some forms of electronic media have been discussed. Hence, excessive 
screen time could result in reduced cognitive abilities in young people 
[35]. Other literature discussed some forms of electronic media, 
including video games, which may assist in improving some children ’s 
cognition-related brain areas, improving their visuospatial skills, 
attention, reading ability, memory, and problem solving skills [36]. Table 1

4Adolescents ’ prolonged sitting time may affect cognition in a variety of 
ways. However, the mechanisms are still unclear. Based on the neuro -
biological evidence, chronic sensory stimulation causes structural 
changes in the developing brain with potentially negative cognitive 
outcomes. The use of screen-based device may also contribute to 
damaged task switching caused by constant distractibility. 
4.3. Physical activity and cognitive difficulty 
The study showed that the relationship between adhering to physical 
activity guidelines and having no cognitive difficulty was not significant 
in adolescents. This result indirectly proves that the link between 
physical activity and cognition in adolescents remains controversial 
[37]. Research on the relationship between moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity (MVPA) and cognition is mixed. It has been estab -
lished that aerobic fitness has obvious relevance to cognition [38]. In 
addition to enhancing aerobic fitness [39], MVPA has also been 
demonstrated to improve cognitive ability indirectly [38]. Moreover, 
physical activity levels decline rapidly during adolescence, a period 
presenting the greatest declines in the physical activity level [40]. 
Increasing studies demonstrate the distinctive effects of physical activity 
on cognitive-related outcomes, including that attention, working 
memory, inhibition, and classroom behaviour are key aspects of cogni -
tion during adolescence [41]. In contrast, other studies provided con-
flicting evidence on the connection between physical activity and 
cognition [42]. A possible explanation for this contradictory evidence is 
that the assessment of cognitive difficulty arbitrarily depends on the 
academic and cognitive measures. Keeley et al. [42] proposes that 
cognitive performance is primarily affected by psycho-physiological 
changes in cerebral function. Accordingly, some studies show that the 
academic measure is moderately correlated with the cognitive measure 
in adolescents [43]. It is during adolescence that neurocognitive 
development is particularly vulnerable and critical. Brain plasticity can 
change with age [44], and some factors involved can be stimulated by 
physical activity [45]. Owing to the conflicting evidence found in our 
study, in the future, more evidence and samples are needed to further 
explore the association between physical activity and cognitive diffi-
culty among adolescents. 
4.4. 24-h movement guidelines and cognitive difficulty 
When adolescents reported adhering to any two of the 24-h move -
ment guidelines, the odds of not experiencing cognitive difficulties 
increased significantly, especially meeting all the 24-h movement 
guidelines. The study findings may support the general finding that 
adherence to 24-h movement guidelines improves cognition-related 
outcomes [24], which implies to the reduced risk of cognitive diffi-
culties [46]. According to Walsh et al. [47], combinations of 24-h 
movement guidelines were related to cognition in children and adoles -
cents. The authors indicated that adhering to all the 24-h guidelines was 
positively associated with global cognition among adolescents. 
Furthermore, meeting the sleep guidelines with one or more of the other 
guidelines conformed with some studies that investigated the impact of 
sleep on cognition [48]. Some studies have investigated the mechanism 
of how sleep affects cognition and have confirmed the positive impacts 
of sufficient sleep on cognitive function in adolescents. Cognitive func-
tion can be enhanced through better working memory, attention, and 
executive control [48]. The most distinct finding in the literature con-
cerning 24-h movement guidelines and cognition-related outcomes [11, 
13,16,17] is that there is no evident dose-response relationship between 
adherence to the guidelines met and cognition-related outcomes. In 
general, adolescents who met all three guidelines experienced no 
cognitive difficulty. Hence, increasing adherence to 24-h guidelines may 
lead to greater cognitive benefits. 4.5. Study limitations 
In light of better understanding of our research findings, it is 
necessary to acknowledge some inherent limitations in this study. First, 
the cross-sectional nature of the study cannot enable causal reference on 
the association between exposure and outcome. Second, as this study is 
based on public data, information or data collected using self-reported 
measures can be affected by measurement errors and social desir-
ability. This limitation would be a barrier to the analysis accuracy. 
Third, as this study did not consider the sleep period on weekend days, it 
is not possible to entirely reflect the average night sleep duration. It is 
expected that future studies will address these weaknesses in the future. 
5.Conclusions 
According to this study, adolescents who adhered to 24-h movement 
guidelines had lower risk of cognitive difficulties. However, adherence 
to screen time and sleep guidelines were the main contributors to no 
cognitive difficulties. To confirm the current research findings, repli-
cated studies with larger sample sizes and device-based measures of 
physical activity, screen time, and sleep are required. Experimental 
studies should also be conducted to examine the research findings.

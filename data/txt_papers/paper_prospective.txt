Abstract: Numerous factors need to be taken into account
when managing a patient with Parkinson’s disease (PD) afterdeep brain stimulation (DBS). Questions such as when to beginprogramming, how to conduct a programming screen, how toassess the effects of programming, and how to titrate stimula-
tion and medication for each of the targeted sites need to be
addressed. Follow-up care should be determined, includingpatient adjustments of stimulation, timing of follow-up visitsand telephone contact with the patient, and stimulation andmedication conditions during the follow-up assessments. Amanagement plan for problems that can arise after DBS such asweight gain, dyskinesia, axial symptoms, speech dysfunction,muscle contractions, paresthesia, eyelid, ocular and visual dis-turbances, and behavioral and cognitive problems should be
developed. Long-term complications such as infection or ero-
sion, loss of effect, intermittent stimulation, tolerance, and painor discomfort can develop and need to be managed. Other
factors that need consideration are social and job-related fac-tors, development of dementia, general medical issues, andlifestyle changes. This report from the Consensus on Deep
Brain Stimulation for Parkinson’s Disease, a project commis-
sioned by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and theMovement Disorder Society, outlines answers to a series ofquestions developed to address all aspects of DBS postopera-tive management and decision-making with a systematic over-view of the literature (until mid-2004) and by the expert opin-ion of the authors.

The management of a Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient
after deep brain stimulation (DBS) is complex and mul-tifaceted. The questions developed and addressed in thisarticle attempt to consider all factors that might be in-volved in the early management, follow-up care, andlong-term follow-up of PD patients undergoing DBS. Inaddition, the authors attempt to deﬁne the best practicesto manage commonly encountered problems and long-term complications of DBS.
METHODS
Search Strategy
A search of the literature from 1965 to May 2004
using Medline was completed and resulted in a total of574 articles related to DBS. The multiple searches usedthe following key words: deep brain stimulation, Parkin-son’s disease, neurostimulation, thalamic stimulation,pallidal stimulation, and subthalamic stimulation. Thesesearches were combined with those of neuropsychology,neuropsychiatry, microelectrode recording, surgicaltechnique, complications, neuroimaging, and targeting.Articles were classiﬁed as preoperative and postopera-tive issues, intraoperative issues, and neuropsychologicalissues. A PDF ﬁle was created for each of the articles thatcould be obtained. This resulted in a CD containingcopies of 522 of the articles, which was distributed toeach member of the writing committee. During the writ-ing process, the authors added an additional 87 articles inorder to provide background references for various is-sues, techniques, and measurement scales discussed inthe articles or to include articles published after May2004 that were determined to be critical in completelyaddressing a particular issue.
Process of Generating Clinical Recommendations
The writing committee was composed of neurologists,
neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, neuropsychiatrists,and researchers with experience and expertise in DBS forParkinson’s disease. The committee was composed ofexperts from multiple centers in North America andEurope. The natural division of important issues related
to DBS was applied and participants were assigned basedon their interests and expertise to separate preoperative,surgical/intraoperative, or postoperative issues commit-tees. The steering committee formulated a series of ques-tions related to all aspects of these three areas, whichwere then reviewed and reﬁned by the committee mem-bers. Committee members were then assigned speciﬁcquestions to answer utilizing the literature compiled asdescribed above. The responses were then reviewed bythe steering committee at a separate meeting and it wasdecided to organize responses by ﬁrst reviewing the“available data”, followed by sections providing “con-clusions”, “pragmatic recommendations,” and “points tobe addressed” by future research. It is generally agreedthat there is insufﬁcient evidence in the currently avail-able literature to formulate deﬁnitive recommendationsand conclusions for most of the questions and issuescovered in the articles. Therefore, subsequently, the en-tire group discussed and revised the recommendationsduring a 3-day meeting. At this meeting, the whole group(members of all three working committees) providedfeedback and agreed on the ﬁnal conclusions to be drawnfrom available data as well as the formulation of prag-matic recommendations recognizing that many of thequestions could not be answered on the basis of currentlyavailable studies. The steering committee members thenreformulated each section and redistributed the docu-ment to their entire working committee for ﬁnal ap-proval. Whenever there were opposing or conﬂictingopinions, further discussion followed and consensus wasreached or outstanding disagreement was speciﬁcallyaddressed in the paper.
1. GENERAL MANAGEMENT ASPECTS
1.1. General Aspects of Early Postoperative
Management
1.1.1. Are There General Treatment
Recommendations for the Early Postoperative
Period?
Available Data
There are no formal studies on immediate postopera-
tive patient management. General health recommenda-tions include the systemic administration of antibioticsintraoperatively and up to the ﬁrst postoperative weekand standard monitoring such as ECG, blood pressure,and vital signs.
1Some patients have postoperative tran-
sitory confusion or agitation,2– 8particularly if mild pre-
operative cognitive impairment was present,2for which
atypical antipsychotics have been used.9In many centers,S220 G. DEUSCHL ET AL.

a postoperative MRI or CT scan is done before stimula-
tor implantation to verify electrode position and to ruleout surgical complications.
3,10 –13 There is limited infor-
mation on the postoperative reintroduction of antiparkin-sonian medication.
14
Conclusions
Standard postoperative care is sufﬁcient providing the
surgery is uncomplicated; postoperative management inthe intensive care unit is not a necessity.
Pragmatic Recommendations
Postoperative antiparkinsonian treatment should be re-
started as soon as possible to relieve discomfort and limitthe risk of acute dopaminergic withdrawal and malignanthyperthermia. The postoperative levodopa equivalentdose (LED) should be the same as the presurgical doseand composed primarily of levodopa to facilitate simpletitration during programming initiation.
Confusional states generally last a few days and can be
easily managed with sedatives such as benzodiazepinesand atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine or quetia-pine. Neuroimaging is highly recommended immediatelyfollowing surgery to conﬁrm electrode location and torule out intracranial adverse events.
Points To Be Addressed
The relationship between postoperative confusional
states and patient age, length of surgery, number ofelectrode passes, microrecording, and stimulation shouldbe investigated to determine predictive risk factors and toallow optimal surgical planning.
1.1.2. When Should DBS Programming Be Started?
Available Data
With the initial introduction of DBS surgery, external
electrode interrogation was commonly performed 7 to 10days postoperatively to determine clinical response. Thestimulator was then implanted if efﬁcacy was demon-strated. External stimulation has since been largelyabandoned.
15
Prior to the initiation of stimulation, surgical tracts
may cause microlesioning effects, which may result intransitory symptom improvement. To get an accuraterepresentation of symptoms, the majority of centers pre-fer to delay programming until parkinsonian signs re-turn,
1,16 tissue heals,17and microlesioning effects wear
off.18Practices among centers vary and the duration of
delay and the extent of hospitalization vary. For instance,stimulation assessment 1 to 2 weeks after sur-gery
10,16,19,20 or hospital discharge after 1 week withstimulation initiation 3 to 4 weeks after surgery1,18,21,22
has been reported. Hospitalization during the stimulation
and medication titration period17has also been described.
Hospital discharge 4 to 7 days after surgery has beenreported; prior to discharge, stimulation was initiated atpreset parameters and the patient was provided withguidelines for stimulation titration and medication reduc-tion with access to a nurse specialist and a follow-up visit6 weeks after surgery.
23
Conclusions
Management approaches are variable and do not ap-
pear to affect patient outcome. The decision regardingthe timing of postoperative programming practices isdependent on available resources and convenience atindividual centers.
Pragmatic Recommendations
The time course for the resolution of microlesioning
effects is an important issue for stimulation initiation butis not well established. As a result, the patient should bemade aware of the potential for ﬂuctuations in stimula-tion effects in the ﬁrst several months. Waiting for theresolution of microlesioning effects should be balancedwith the need to relieve patient symptoms.
1.1.3. How to Proceed in Assessing Stimulation
Effects and Optimizing Stimulation Parameters?
Available Data
The assessment of clinical features when optimizing
stimulation parameters is not generally reported in pa-
pers on DBS efﬁcacy. A few papers address the criteriato assess stimulation effects,
17,24,25 which include wrist
rigidity, tremor (if present), bradykinesia, and gait
instability.
Conclusions
There are no formal studies assessing stimulation ef-
fects. Assessment strategies are not uniform, althoughsome items are common to several centers as discussedbelow.
Pragmatic Recommendations
Stimulation effects are generally assessed in two sep-
arate stages. In the ﬁrst stage, a preliminary interrogationusing a monopolar conﬁguration is performed to deter-mine efﬁcacy and side effects of each contact. The con-tact with the greatest efﬁcacy and fewest side effects isselected. Stimulation intensity is slowly increased usingcommonly accepted pulse widths and frequencies. In thesecond stage, a clinical assessment is performed, duringPOSTOPERATIVE ISSUES S221

which antiparkinsonian medications and stimulation pa-
rameters are adjusted as necessary.
After selection of the optimal contact, symptom re-
duction should be veriﬁed. Rigidity, a sign time-lockedwith stimulation,
17is the most useful acute parameter to
assess given its consistency, reproducibility, and inde-pendence from patient cooperation. A provocation ma-neuver such as elevating the contralateral arm can beperformed should baseline rigidity be insufﬁcient.Tremor, if present, can be used as a secondary targetsymptom. Bradykinesia is less reliable given its potentialinteraction with patient motivation and fatigue. Responseof this feature to stimulation occurs with variable latencyand small changes can be difﬁcult to detect and quantify.
The aims of long-term stimulation are to control
symptoms and to improve features such as on–offphe-
nomena, dyskinesias, and sleep disturbances. Levodopaand subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation have similarand additive effects, but the latter has the advantage ofcontinuous and nonﬂuctuating symptom control. The op-timal goal should be the gradual reduction of drug doseswith optimized stimulation.
If satisfactory results are not achieved or signiﬁcant
discrepancies exist between the effects of levodopa andbilateral STN DBS, electrode positioning should bechecked and technical problems should be ruled out.
26
1.1.4. Why Is the Screening Session Important and
How Should It Be Approached?
Available Data and Conclusions
There are no formal studies on the initiation of stim-
ulation. The available data are based on expert opin-ion.
17,24 –26 Stimulation effects are assessed in two stages
as discussed above. The ﬁrst determines the effects andside effects of each contact using a monopolar conﬁgu-ration. One contact is then selected and the stimulationstrength is slowly increased using commonly acceptedpulse widths and frequency parameters.
Pragmatic Recommendations
The ﬁrst priority in programming is to determine the
optimal electrode contact by interrogating each contactfor efﬁcacy and side effects. The optimal contact ideallyhas the widest therapeutic window deﬁned as the ampli-tude interval between the lowest voltage required to elicitclinical effects and the lowest voltage eliciting unwantedside effects. The type of side effect elicited has differingimplications. For instance, the elicitation of dyskinesiapredicts a favorable long-term outcome indicative of awell-placed electrode, whereas other side effects may bedue to the current spread to surrounding structures out-side of the STN. These other side effects include con-
tralateral gaze deviation, hemibody muscle contraction,dysesthesias, dysconjugate ocular deviation, postural in-stability, gait ataxia, sweating, and mydriasis. The selec-tion of the appropriate contact requires differentiatingbetween transitory and persistent side effects.
Hierarchy of the Four Contacts
The determination of which contact to utilize for
chronic stimulation requires a careful bilateral assess-ment of the efﬁcacy of each contact on parkinsoniansymptoms while taking into account the therapeutic win-dow. While a range of symptoms may be assessed, thetarget symptom may differ depending on the nuclei se-lected for stimulation: for example, tremor for ventralintermediate nucleus (Vim); rigidity, tremor, and brady-kinesia for STN; dyskinesias, rigidity, and bradykinesiafor globus pallidus internus (GPi).
17The assessment of
two consecutive contacts requires a sufﬁcient duration ofstimulation discontinuation to allow a return of symp-toms to baseline.
Polarity
Monopolar stimulation is generally selected for cur-
rent delivery; it is considered the most effective optionand the vast majority of patients are successfully pro-grammed with a single contact.
27–29 Bipolar stimulation
may be preferred if a narrower current to reduce theelicitation of side effects is desired.
23Double monopolar
stimulation may be warranted if a single electrode isinsufﬁcient to produce an optimal effect.
17
Amplitude, Pulse Width, and Frequency
During the initial assessment, it is suggested that the
pulse and frequency be held constant while the amplitudeis assessed in increasing increments of 0.5 V from 0 to 6V. A pulse width of 60 milliseconds is usually selected asthe best compromise between clinical beneﬁt and sideeffects.
30A frequency of 130 Hz is generally used during
the initial assessment while a higher frequency (185 Hz)may be used for tremor control in Vim
16,31,32 and in STN
stimulation.26
1.1.5. How Should Stimulation and Medications Be
Titrated for the Three Different Targets?
Available Data
STN stimulation initiation is more complex than that
of GPi or Vim due to the need to balance medicationreduction with increasing stimulation intensity.

sion, apathy, and hypomania may develop.17In contrast,
with GPi and Vim stimulation, intensity can be increasedin larger and more rapid increments without alteringmedication. With GPi DBS, antiparkinsonian drugs areeither unchanged,
28,33 slightly increased,34or slightly
decreased.35With Vim DBS, antiparkinsonian drugs are
either unchanged20or slightly reduced in a minority of
patients.31,36 There are no formal studies examining
which type of antiparkinsonian medications may be moreeffective for patients following DBS.
Conclusions
In STN DBS, increasing stimulation parameters are
usually accompanied by a reduction in medication dos-ages. In GPi DBS and Vim DBS, medication dosagesusually do not change signiﬁcantly.
Pragmatic Recommendations
The goal of medication titration is to achieve a balance
between optimizing stimulation effects with concomitantmedication reduction and minimizing side effects fromexcessive reduction of systemic dopaminergic stimula-tion. Levodopa or dopamine agonists can be used, andthere are no established criteria regarding preference.Criteria are the continuous improvement of the mobilityand absence of dyskinesias or other unwanted sideeffects.
1.2. General Aspects of Follow-Up
1.2.1. Should Patients Be Trained to Adjust
Stimulation Parameters?
Available Data
With Vim DBS, patients are usually instructed to
switch OFF the stimulators at night
20,37 to spare battery
life and reduce the possibility of tolerance. This is notrecommended for patients with stimulators in the STN orGPi.
The Access Review Therapy Controller (Medtronic,
Minneapolis, MN) allows patients with a Kinetra im-plantable pulse generator (IPG) (Medtronic) to makeminor adjustments of stimulation parameters (particu-larly of the current amplitude) within the limits set by theprogrammer, whereas the Itrel or Soletra IPGs(Medtronic) do not allow patient adjustment of stimula-tion. Therefore, patient training to adjust stimulators isdevice-dependent and is used by some
38but not all
centers.4,39So far, speciﬁc behavioral problems related to
self-adaptation of stimulation have not been reported.Conclusions
In patients with Kinetra IPGs, the Access Review
Therapy Controller allows for limited patient adjustmentof stimulation parameters, which can enhance symptomcontrol and allow for nocturnal battery sparing.
Pragmatic Recommendations
Patients or caregivers must know how to turn the
stimulator ON and OFF with either a handheld magnet orthe Access Review Therapy Controller. Patients andcaregivers should also be instructed on how to check thestatus of the stimulator with the Access Review TherapyController. If the controller is not available, a transistorradio set to an AM band can be used to determine if thestimulator is ON or OFF.
In patients with Kinetra IPGs, the Access Review
Therapy Controller can allow the patient to switch be-tween preset stimulation parameters. This option can beoffered to highly cooperative patients or caregivers withproven reliability in recognizing clinical features as wellas a clear understanding of stimulation manipulation.
1.2.2. What Are the Criteria for Scheduling Follow-
Up Visits and Telephone Contacts After Surgery?
Available Data
There are no formal criteria for scheduling follow-up
visits or telephone contacts after surgery. In most cen-ters, patients are encouraged to contact the treatmentteam whenever necessary.
37,40 The number of visits tend
to decrease after the ﬁrst postoperative year, when stim-ulation parameters and medication titration has stabi-lized.
38In contrast, some centers do schedule regular
follow-up visits at prespeciﬁed intervals.22,29,39
Conclusions
The frequency of interim visits at each center depends
on patients’ needs and on the available resources (e.g.,physicians, nurses, secretaries, call centers).
Pragmatic Recommendations
Regular follow-up visits are recommended and can be
customized according to individual need. Patients requirefollow-up for as long as they have an implanted device.Device malfunctioning, battery depletion, and ongoingPD management should be monitored. Many centershave scheduled visits at 3 and 6 months and thereafterannually.
Points To Be Addressed
An algorithm for postoperative stimulation manage-
ment and cost– effectiveness analyses are potential topicsfor further investigation.POSTOPERATIVE ISSUES S223

1.2.3. Should OFF Stimulation Assessments Be
Routinely Done and, If So, How Long Should the
Stimulators Be Turned OFF Prior to the
Assessments?
Available Data
There are no formal studies addressing the necessity
for OFF stimulation assessments. There is evidence that75% of all symptoms usually return after 30 minutes ofstopping stimulation. After 3 to 4 hours, deterioration ofmotor symptoms levels off at 90%.
41Switching OFF the
stimulator overnight in patients with STN stimulators isnot well tolerated.
42
Conclusions
Turning OFF the stimulation for 30 minutes for OFF
stimulation assessment is generally sufﬁcient for mostinvestigations.
Pragmatic Recommendations
Motor evaluations in the OFF stimulation condition
are not necessary for routine evaluations. Certain circum-stances (e.g., complaints of side effects such as dystonia,dyskinesias, and postural instability that may be relatedeither to stimulation or to poor symptom control) mayrequire evaluation of the patient OFF stimulation. Asuprathreshold levodopa challenge OFF stimulation pre-dicts the maximal achievable beneﬁt and reveals levo-dopa-resistant motor problems. Motor signs should im-prove to the same degree with both levodopa andstimulation. Reasons for any discrepancies should beexplored (e.g., improper lead location, choice of stimu-lation parameters, and the behavioral state of the patient).Routine evaluations in the OFF stimulation condition canonly be justiﬁed in the context of research protocols.
2. MANAGEMENT OF COMMON
POSTOPERATIVE PROBLEMS AND
OPTIMIZATION IN THE POSTOPERATIVE
PERIOD
2.1. Management of Common Postoperative
Problems
2.1.1. Management of Weight Gain
Available Data
Weight gain has been reported to occur after surgical
therapy for PD. An incidence of 6% to 100% has beenreported for STN DBS
6,29,40,43– 46 and of 26% to 96% for
GPi DBS.47There are no reports on weight gain follow-
ing Vim DBS. The extent of weight gain may be higherin STN DBS
48,49 than in GPi DBS.47The etiology ofweight gain is unclear and has been postulated to be due
to an effect of DBS on hypothalamic centers, changes indopaminergic reduction, and a decrease in energy expen-diture due to amelioration of dyskinesias.
48,49
Conclusions
Weight gain is a common phenomenon following
DBS for PD.
Pragmatic Recommendations
Candidates for a surgical procedure may be given pre-
operative nutritional counseling to prevent excessive weightgain. Uncontrolled long-term observations suggest that theweight of most patients normalizes after 1 or 2 years.
2.1.2. Management of Dyskinesias
Available Data
STN DBS can trigger initial choreiform, ballistic, or
dystonic movements that may resemble levodopa-in-duced dyskinesias.
50,51 The appearance of dyskinesias
assists in the conﬁrmation of appropriate electrode loca-tion in the STN.
52–54 Dyskinesias usually disappear with
chronic STN stimulation50and are markedly improved in
the long term.9,22,29,55,56 Given the similar effect of STN
stimulation and medication, postoperative reduction ofdopaminergic medication is regarded as an importantgoal in many studies.
9,56 –58
GPi DBS has not been reported to induce dyskinesias
and there are no reports of an ampliﬁcation effect ofmedication and stimulation. On the contrary, GPi DBS isbelieved to exert a direct antidyskinetic effect
34,59 with
greater antidyskinetic efﬁcacy suggested in posterior–ventrally located contacts than dorsal contacts.
27Vim
DBS has been reported to have minimal6 0–6 2 or no im-
pact on levodopa-induced dyskinesias.20
Conclusions
STN DBS may aggravate levodopa-induced dyskinesias
in the immediate postoperative period. There are no formalstudies on the adjustment of stimulation parameters anddopaminergic medications to prevent or manage postoper-ative dyskinesias in STN DBS. Management is based onsingle-case reports and expert opinion. GPi DBS exerts adirect antidyskinetic effect, whereas Vim DBS has littleinﬂuence on levodopa-induced dyskinesias in PD.
Pragmatic Recommendations
In the immediate postoperative period following STN
DBS, simpliﬁcation of the medication regimen is advisablegiven the complexity of the interactions between stimula-tion and medications. Monotherapy with immediate releaseS224 G. DEUSCHL ET AL.

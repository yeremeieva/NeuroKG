Depression has become a major threat to human health, and res earchers around the
world are actively engaged in research on depression. In ord er to promote closer
research, the study of the global depression knowledge map i s signiﬁcant. This study
aims to map the knowledge map of depression research and show the current research
distribution, hotspots, frontiers, and trends in the ﬁeld o f depression research, providing
researchers with worthwhile information and ideas. Based o n the Web of Science
core collection of depression research from 2004 to 2019, th is study systematically
analyzed the country, journal, category, author, institut ion, cited article, and keyword
aspects using bibliometric and data visualization methods . A relationship network
of depression research was established, highlighting the h ighly inﬂuential countries,
journals, categories, authors, institutions, cited artic les, and keywords in this research
ﬁeld. The study identiﬁes great research potential in the ﬁe ld of depression, provides
scientiﬁc guidance for researchers to ﬁnd potential collab orations through collaboration
networks and coexistence networks, and systematically and accurately presents the
hotspots, frontiers, and shortcomings of depression resea rch through the knowledge
map of global research on depression with the help of informa tion analysis and
fusion methods, which provides valuable information for re searchers and institutions to
determine meaningful research directions.

environment that is developing at an increasing rate. Prolon ged exposure to stress can have a
negative impact on brain development ( 1), and depression is one of the more typical disorders
that accompany it. Stress will increase the incidence of depres sion (2), depression has become
a common disease ( 3), endangering people’s physical health. Depression is a debilit ating mental
illness with mood disorders, also known as major depression, clinical depression, or melancholia.

thatthreatenshundredsofmillionsofpeopleworldwide.
Along with the rise of science communication research, the
quantiﬁcation of science is also ﬂourishing. As a combinati on
of “data science” and modern science, bibliometrics takes
advantage of the explosive growth of research output in
the era of big data, and uses topics, authors, publications,
keywords, references, citations, etc. as research targets to
reveal the current status and impact of the discipline more
accurately and scientiﬁcally. Whereas, there is not a wealt h of
bibliometric studies related to depression. Fusar-Poli et al . (6)

The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and
systematic literature-based data mining and metrics analys is
of depression-related research. More speciﬁcally, this analys is
focuses on cooperative network and co-presentation analysis,
based on the 36,477 papers included in the Web of Science
Core Collection database from 2004 to 2019, and provides
an in-depth analysis of cooperative network, co-presentation
network, and co-citation through modern metrics and data

temporal distribution of research countries, journals, aut hors,and institutions in the ﬁeld of depression in a more concise
manner through a relational network. A deeper understanding
of the internal structure of the research community will hel p

Methods of Analysis
This study uses bibliometrics and data visualization as ana lytical
methods. First, the application of bibliometrics to the ﬁeld of
depression helped to identify established and emerging resea rch
clusters,demonstratingthevalueofresearchinthisarea. Second,
data visualization provides multiple perspectives on the data,
presenting correlations in a clearer “knowledge graph” that
can reveal underestimated and overlooked trends, patterns, and
diﬀerences( 19).CiteSpaceismainlybasedonthe“co-occurrence
clusteringidea,”whichextractstheinformationunits(ke ywords,
authors, institutions, countries, journals, etc.) in the d ata by
classiﬁcation, and then further reconstructs the data in th e
informationunitstoformnetworksbasedondiﬀerenttypesand
strengths of connections (e.g., keyword co-occurrence, au thor
collaboration, etc.). The resulting networks include node s and
links, where the nodes represent the information units of the
literature and the links represent the existence of connecti ons
(co-occurrence) between the nodes. Finally, the network is
measured, statistically analyzed, and presented in a visual way.
The analysis needs to focus on: the overall structure of the
network, key nodes and paths. The key evaluation indicators i n
this study are: betweenness centrality, year, keyword freq uency,
andburststrength.Betweennesscentrality(BC)isthenumb erof

a measure of the importance of articles found and measured
by nodes in the network by labeling the category (or authors,
journals, institutions, etc.) with purple circles. There may be
many shortest paths between two nodes in the network, and by

LARGE-SCALE ASSESSMENT
Country Analysis
Duringtheperiod2004–2019,atotalof157countries/territ ories
haveconductedresearchondepression,whichisabout67.38% of
233 countries/territories worldwide. This shows that depre ssion
is receiving attention from many countries/regions around the
world.Figure1showsthegeographicaldistributionofpublished
articles for 157 countries. The top 15 countries are ranked
according to the number of articles published. Table1lists the
top 15 countries with the highest number of publications in
the ﬁeld of depression worldwide from 2004 to 2019. These
15 countries include 4 Asian countries (Peoples R China,
Japan, South Korea, Turkey), 2 North American countries
(USA, Canada), 1 South American country (Brazil), 7 European
countries (UK, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, France, Spain,
Sweden),and1Oceaniacountry(Australia).
Overall, the main distribution of these articles is in USA and
some European countries, such as UK, Germany, Netherlands,
Italy,France,Spain,andSweden.Thismeansthatthesecount ries
are more interested and focused on research on depression
compared to others. The total number of publications across
all research areas in the Web of Science core collection is
similar to the distribution of depression research areas, wi th
the trend toward USA, UK, and Peoples R China as leading
countries being unmistakable, and USA has been a leader
in the ﬁeld of depression, with far more articles published
than any other country. It can also be seen that USA is
the country with the highest betweenness centrality in the
network of national collaborations analyzed in this paper. USA
research in the ﬁeld of depression is closely linked to global
research, and is an important part of the global collaborative
network for depression research. As of 2019, the total number
ofarticlespublishedindepressionperformanceresearchinUSA
represents 27.13% of the total number of articles published
in depression worldwide, which is ∼4 times more than the
second-placecountry,UK,whichisfaraheadofothercountrie s.
Peoples R China, as the third most published country, has a
dominant number of articles, but its betweenness centralit y is

of scientiﬁc research on depression in each country is about
0.19%, also highlighting the urgent need to address depressio n
as one of the global human health problems. The four Asian
countries included in the top 15 countries are Peoples R China ,
Japan, South Korea, and Turkey, with Peoples R China ranking

number of people suﬀering from depression increasing at a
patient rate of 18.4% between 2005 and 2015. Depression, one
of the most prevalent mental illnesses of our time, has caused
both physical and psychological harm to many people, and it
has become the leading cause of disability worldwide today, a nd
in this context, there is increased interest and focus on res earch
into depression. It is expected that a more comprehensive
understanding of depression and ﬁnding ways to prevent and
cope with the occurrence of this disease can help people get
rid of the pain and shadow brought by depression, obtain a
healthy and comfortable physical and mental environment and
physical health, and make Chinese contributions to the cause
of human health. Undoubtedly, the occurrence of depressive
illnessesinthecontextofirreversiblehumansocialdevel opment
has stimulated a vigorous scientiﬁc research environment o n

and contributed to the improvement of research capacity in
these countries. Moreover, from a diﬀerent perspective, the

per year. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the period 2004–
2019 can be divided into three main growth periods, namely
2004–2009, 2010–2012, and 2013–2019, the ﬁrst growth period
being from 2004 to 2009, the number of publications totaled
6,749, accounting for 23.97% of all publications; from 2010 t o
2012, the number of publications totaled 8,236, accounting f or
17.56% of all publications; and from 2013 to 2019, the number
of publications totaled 22,473, accounting for 58.47% of all
publications. Of these, 2006 was the ﬁrst year of sharp growth

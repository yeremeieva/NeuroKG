Parkinson's disease (PD)patients whocontracted Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐
19)hadadecline inmotor functions; nevertheless, there islimited evidence on
whether PDpatients have ahigher riskforcontracting Covid‐19 orhave worse
outcomes. Thisisthefirstsystematic review andmeta‐analysis toreview theimpact
ofPDontheprognosis ofCovid‐19 patients. Weperformed asystematic search
through seven electronic databases under therecommendations ofthePreferred
Reporting Items forSystematic Review andMeta‐analyses statement (PRISMA)
guidelines. TheRsoftware version 4.0.2 wasused tocalculate pooled sample sizes
andtheir associated confidence intervals (95%CI). Finally, weincluded 13papers in
thisstudy. Thepooled prevalence rateofCovid‐19 was2.12% (95%CI: 0.75–5.98).
Fever, cough, fatigue andanorexia were themost common symptoms witharateof
72.72% (95% CI:57.3 ‐92.29), 66.99% (95% CI:49.08–91.42), 61.58% (95% CI:
46.69–81.21) and52.55% (95% CI:35.09–78.68), respectively. Thepooled rates
were 39.89% (95% CI:27.09–58.73) forhospitalisation, 4.7% (95% CI:1.56–14.16)
forICU admission and25.1% (95%CI: 16.37–38.49) formortality. Onfurther
comparison ofhospitalisation andmortality rates among Covid‐19 patients withand
without PD,there were nosignificant differences. Inconclusion, theprevalence and
prognosis ofCovid‐19 patients seem comparable inpatients with PDandthose
without it.Theincreased hospitalisation andmortality maybeattributed tooldage
andco‐morbidities.

1|INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19) isoneofthebeta coronavi-
ruses (βCoVs), which hasawell‐documented propensity ofneuro-
invasion, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS‐CoV),1Middle Eastrespiratory syndrome–related coronavirus
(MERS‐COV),2human coronavirus 229E,3human coronavirus OC43
(HCoV‐OC43).4,5Insome earlier studies, SARS‐CoV particles were
found inthebrain ofSARS patients,6–8which wasalsoexperimentally
produced through intranasal injection ofSARS‐CoV5orMERS‐COV,2
passing through theolfactory nerves.5Although theexact route of
SARS‐CoV orMERS‐COV reaching thebrain isunknown, non‐
neurological routes arenotprobable since noviral particles were
detected innon‐neuronal cells ofinfected brain regions.6–8Viral in-
vasion oftheterminal nerves followed bytrans‐synaptic transfer to
thecentral nervous system iswell‐documented forhaemagglutinat-
ingencephalomyelitis virus 67(HEV67)9–12andavian bronchitis vi-
rus,13,14which aremembers ofthecorona family.5,15Noteworthy,
theHEV67 shares over 91%homology withHCoV‐OC43.16,17Taken
together, SARS‐CoV‐2 mostly hasthesame neuroinvasive propensity
documented inother CoVs.
Ingeneral, Covid‐19 neurological manifestations were evident in
many patients since thevery beginning ofthispandemic, ranging
from mildheadache, nausea, vomiting, anduptogeneralised seizure
andaltered consciousness.18–23Less frequent, yetimportant, mani-
festations include seizures, strokes ofmultiple etiologies, and
Guillain‐Barre syndrome.20–22,24,25The possible neuroinvasive
mechanism may help explain therespiratory failure inCOVID‐19
patients; themedian time from thefirst symptom torespiratory
deterioration (5–8 days) isenough forviralparticles toinfiltrate the
brain anddisrupt medullary neurons.5,10
TheCovid‐19‐related case fatality ishigher among vulnerable
groups such asolder agegroups andthose with co‐morbidities.26–28
Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) show multiple patterns of
vulnerability, being advanced inage, mostly have age‐related
chronic conditions, andrelated polypharmacy burden.29Thecur-
rent literature shows that PDpatients who contracted Covid‐19
hadadecline inmotor functions andstress‐induced psychiatric
problems (e.g., anxiety andmood changes)30–34;however, whether
PDpatients have ahigher riskforcontracting Covid‐19 orhave
worse outcomes isstilldebatable.35–39This isthefirstsystematic
review and meta‐analysis toreview theimpact ofPDonthe
prognosis ofCovid‐19 patients.
2|METHODS
2.1 |Searchstrategyandstudyselection
Weperformed asystemic search through theelectronic databases
from thecommencement andtill12thMarch 2021 under therec-
ommendations ofthePreferred Reporting Items forSystematic
Review andMeta‐analyses statement (PRISMA) guidelines.40Thesearch went through seven databases including System forInfor-
mation onGrey Literature inEurope, Google Scholar, Web ofSci-
ence, PubMed, Scopus, TheNew York Academy ofMedicine, and
Virtual Health Library, under thesearch term ([Parkinson] AND
[Covid‐19 ORCOVID 19ORnovel coronavirus]). Toensure not
missing anypaper, amanual search wasconducted after thesys-
temic oneusing various methods, allrelevant papers inPubMed and
Google Scholar were checked, wesearched intothereferences of
papers included from thesystemic search, andwealsoused rele-
vant Mesh terms andkeywords tocheck formissing papers.41,42
Duplication between database results wasremoved using EndNote
X8software. Four authors independently reviewed search results
from thetitle and theabstract considering ourinclusion and
exclusion criteria inapreformed excel sheet, alloriginal papers
reporting patients with PDandCovid‐19 were included. Wemade
norestrictions forthelanguage, country, study design, age,sex,or
ethnicity ofpatients. Reviews, animal studies, papers with over-
lapping data, incomplete data ornotreliable forextraction, case
reports, case series lessthan fivepatients andpapers including the
same patients inapreviously included paper were allexcluded. We
performed another phase offull‐text screening togetthefinal
included studies andidentify papers eligible fortheanalysis. A
study wasincluded when allthereviewers agreed toinclude it;
whenever contradiction wasfound, adiscussion washeldtoresolve
theconflict using asenior reviewer ifneeded.
2.2 |Dataextraction
Wedeveloped adataextraction form using Microsoft Excel‐based on
thetype ofdata inourincluded papers. Theextraction sheet con-
sisted ofthree domains. Thefirstoneincluded study ID,study design,
sample size,age,male prevalence, andmethod ofCovid‐19 diagnosis.
Thesecond part included ouroutcomes ofinterest (prevalence of
Covid‐19 inPD,theprevalence ofmortality, hospitalisation, intensive
careunit(ICU) admission, length ofhospital stay, manifestations, and
comorbidities inPDpatients with Covid‐19). Thethird partincluded
thequality rating oftheincluded studies. Three authors indepen-
dently extracted thedata from included papers using theformed
excel sheet. Another fourth author was added torecheck the
extracted data. Adiscussion washeldtosolve anydisputations. Upon
reaching thefinalextracted data, wemade another phase ofchecking
toensure thevalidity ofthedata.
2.3 |Qualityassessment
Weused theNational Institutes ofHealth (NIH) tool forthe
methodological quality assessment ofincluded studies.43Three in-
dependent reviewers evaluated each study using apre‐formed 14
question assessment sheet forthecohort and cross‐sectional
studies, 12questions forthecase‐control studies andnine ques-
tionassessment sheet forthecase series studies. Thefinaldecision2of11
/
EL‐QUSHAYRI ETAL.wasbased upon adiscussion between thereviewers. Depending on
theanswers tothequestions ascore wasgiven foreach study.
Regarding cohort andcross ‐sectional studies, an11to14score was
considered tohave agood quality, a6to10score wasconsidered
tohave afairquality, andbelow 6scores were considered tohave a
lowquality. Meanwhile, incase series studies good quality was
adopted when thescore was 7–9 points, fairquality andpoor
quality were considered ifthescore was3–6and0–3points, in
order. Forcase‐control studies, thescores forgood, fairandpoor
quality wasreported when thepoints fallintherange of10–12, 7–
9and0–6, respectively.
2.4 |Statisticalanalysis
Weused Rsoftware version 4.0.2 toperform themeta ‐analysis
whenever available. Event rate andthecorresponding 95% confi-
dence interval (CI)were used toanalyse categorical data. Meanwhile,
thepooled mean difference (MD) andthecorresponding 95%CIwasused toanalyse continuous data. Theodds ratio (OR) with 95% CI
wasused toanalyse categorical outcomes when outcomes oftwo
compared groups were presented inmore than onestudy. Asignifi-
cant difference wasconsidered when thepvalue was <0.05. Het-
erogeneity between studies wasevaluated using theI‐squared and
Q‐test, significant heterogeneity wasconsidered when thep‐value
exceeds 0.1.44Weused afixed ‐effect model under Mantel ‐Haenszel
methods when there wasnoevidence forheterogeneity; otherwise, a
random effect model wasused topool thedata.45Weperformed
publication biasaccording tothemethod ofEgger andcolleagues if
theoutcomes were presented inmore than 10studies.46,47
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Studycharacteristics
Weexported 910records intoendnote after performing thesys-
tematic search, ofthose 89records were considered asduplicates.

byafull‐text screening of51eligible fulltexts. Finally, weincluded
eight papers from thesystematic search inaddition tofivepapers
obtained bythemanual search making atotal of13papers48–60
(Figure 1).One paper wasexcluded duetotheinclusion ofdupli-
catepatients,61andanother onereported combined outcomes ofPD
patients combined with parkinsonism patients.62
Regarding study design, there were fiveretrospective cohorts,
three case‐controls, twocross‐sectionals, twocase series, andone
prospective cohort (Table 1).Weincluded 8649 PDpatients and
88710 control subjects. Covid‐19 diagnosis wasreported inonly
sixpapers. One paper wascategorised aspoor quality while therestofthepapers were categorised asfairquality (Table S1,S2
andS3).
3.2 |PrevalenceofCovid19amongpatientswith
PD
Four studies reported theprevalence ofCovid‐19 inatotal of6878
PDpatients. Thepooled prevalence rateofCovid‐19 was2.12% (95%
CI:0.75–5.98); nevertheless, heterogeneity wassignificant among
thepooled studies (I2=95%; p<0.001) with prevalence rates
ranging from 0.94% to8.51% (Figure 2).

EL‐QUSHAYRI ETAL.Toinvestigate thepresence ofpossible co‐founders tothe
investigated prevalence rates, therates ofdifferent comorbidities
among PDpatients were compared inSARS ‐CoV‐2positive and
SARS ‐CoV‐2negative patients. The results showed significantly
higher rates ofdiabetes mellitus (OR: 2.12, 95% CI:1.06–4.23;
p=0.033) andimmunocompromise (OR: 2.06, 95% CI:1.08–3.94;
p=0.029), with noheterogeneity inboth analyses (I2=0%).How-
ever, nosignificant differences were noticed intherates ofhyper-
tension, obesity, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, or
cardiomyopathy (Figure 3).
3.3 |Covid ‐19manifestations amongpatientswith
PD
Fever, cough, fatigue andanorexia were found tobethemost com-
mon symptoms with arateof72.72% (95% CI:57.3–92.29), 66.99%
(95% CI:49.08–91.42), 61.58% (95% CI:46.69–81.21) and52.55%
(95% CI:35.09–78.68), respectively. Heterogeneity wasonly found
among cough (I2=79%; p<0.001), fever (I2=73%; p<0.001), and
diarrhoea (I2=64%; p<0.064) analyses (Figure 4a).Onthefurther
comparison ofPDpatients with Covid ‐19totheCovid ‐19patients
without PD,there wasnosignificant difference incough (OR: 0.93,
95% CI:0.01–98.09; p=0.977) orfever (OR: 0.54, 95% CI:0.22–
1.32; p=0.177) rates. There wasasignificant heterogeneity inthe
cough comparison (I2=86%; p=0.008), while thefever analysis did
notshow thesame (I2=0%;p=0.819) (Figure 4b).
3.4 |Patientoutcomes
Hospitalisation wasreported ineight studies (263 patients) with a
pooled rate of39.89% (95% CI:27.09–58.73); nevertheless, there
wasasignificant heterogeneity among thepooled studies (I2=81%;
p<0.001) (Figure 5a).Moreover, thelength ofhospital stay was
comparable inPDpatients with Covid ‐19andCovid ‐19patients
without PD(MD: 2.69, 95%CI: −6.99–12.37; p=0.586), with no
heterogeneity observed (I2=0%;p=0.396) (Figure 5b).Inthesame
context, thepooled rateofICUadmission was4.7% (95% CI:1.56–
14.16) withnopresent heterogeneity (I2=0%;p=0.655) (Figure 5a).
Themortality rates among PDpatients with Covid ‐19were re-
ported in11studies with atotal of928 patients. The pooledmortality ratewasfound tobe25.1% (95% CI:16.37–38.49), with
significant heterogeneity among theincluded studies (I2=77%;
p<0.001)(Figure 5a).TheEgger's regression testshowed norisk
biasinthemortality analysis (p=0.972). Onfurther comparison of
mortality rates among Covid ‐19patients with PDandthose with
Covid ‐19without PD,there were nosignificant differences among
thetwogroups (OR: 1.42, 95% CI:0.26; 7.70; p=0.687). However,
there was significant heterogeneity among theincluded studies
(I2=82%; p=0.003) (Figure 5c).
4|DISCUSSION
Inthismeta ‐analysis, weinvestigated whether PDhasasignificant
impact ontheseverity andprognosis ofCovid ‐19infections. Our
pooled analysis oftherelevant studies showed that thehospital-
isation rateforPDpatients with Covid ‐19infections was39.89%,
while thetotal mortality ratewas25.1%. Ourestimated mortality
rateismuch higher than thepreviously reported rates forPDpa-
tients from thegeneral population.63Akbar etal.64conducted along‐
term follow ‐upinvestigation intheUnited States tofindthatamong
hospitalised patients, themortality rateforPDwas17%, which was
alsosmaller than therateforthenon‐PDincluded population (22%)
over 32years. Aprevious systematic review byMacleod etal.65re-
ported thatamong 88studies, theestimated mortality ratio ranged
between 0.9and3.8%, with thisratio reportedly increasing over
time. Ontheother hand, aprevious meta ‐analysis byXuetal.66re-
ported thatPDincreased theriskofall‐cause mortality forpatients
suffering from thedisease by2.2foldhigher than thegeneral pop-
ulation. Moreover, another meta ‐analysis reported that infections
were thecommonest cause forhospitalisation forPDpatients.67
ForCovid ‐19infections tooccur, SARS ‐CoV‐2must attach toits
receptors within human cells, namely angiotensin ‐converting enzyme
2(ACE2) receptors, which canbeextensively found within the
epithelial cellsoftherespiratory tract. Moreover, thesame receptors
were also observed within dopaminergic neuronal cells,68which
might explain thepotential association between Covid ‐19infections
andneurological disorders. Recent studies have alsodescribed the
potential rolethat angiotensin might have inPDbyinduction of
neurodegeneration through some pro‐oxidative and pro‐
inflammatory actions.69Aprevious investigation byNataf etal.70
alsoreported thatACE2 andDopa Decarboxylase (DDC) probably

ABSTRACT
Background: Deep brain stimulation is a treatment under investigation for a range of psychiatric disor-
ders. It has shown promising results for therapy-refractory obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and
major depressive disorder (MDD). Other indications under investigation include Tourette’s syndrome,anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders.Aims: To review current studies on psychiatric indications for deep brain stimulation (DBS), with focus
on OCD and MDD.
Method: A systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, and the literature was searched to identify
studies with DBS for psychiatric disorders. The identified studies were analysed based on patient charac-
teristics, treatment results and adverse effects of DBS.
Results: A total of 52 papers met the inclusion criteria and described a total of 286 unique patients
treated with DBS for psychiatric indications; 18 studies described 112 patients treated with DBS for OCDin six different anatomical targets, while nine studies presented 100 patients with DBS for MDD in five
different targets.
Conclusion: DBS may show promise for treatment-resistant OCD and MDD but the results are limited
by small sample size and insufficient randomized controlled data. Deep brain stimulation for OCD hasreceived United States Food and Drug Administration approval. Other psychiatric indications are cur-
rently of a purely experimental nature.ARTICLE HISTORY

indications; Obsessive–
compulsive disorder; Majordepressive disorder
Many patients suffering from a mental disorder can be success-
fully treated with conventional non-invasive methods such aspharmacological treatments or psychotherapy. However, thereis still a remaining group of patients in whom these methodsgive little or no relief. With this background, stereotactic deepbrain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a possibility.
Stereotactic functional neurosurgery was first developed in
1947 and is today an established treatment for movement
disorders ( 1). New indications for DBS are under evaluation,
such as headache, epilepsy and psychiatric conditions; mainlyOCD and MDD ( 2).
The surgical procedure is initiated by mounting a stereotac-
tic frame on the head of the patient and a magnetic reson-ance image (MRI) is performed. Using a computerizednavigational system the target structure is identified on the
MRI and a trajectory chosen. In the operating theatre a burr
hole is made on each side of the midline for the implantationof two electrodes. The electrodes are about 1.3 mm in diam-eter with several contacts at their distal end. An extensioncable is tunnelated under the skin, connecting the electrodeswith a neuropacemaker placed below the clavicle in a subcuta-neous pocket. The hospitalization time after surgery is depend-ent on the time needed for programming of the device, but
the patients can usually return home within 3–5 days ( 3).The post-operative phase consists of programming to
determine the stimulation parameters: electrode contactsused, voltage, pulse-width and frequency. The optimal param-eters are individual for the patient. The aim is to optimize theeffect on the psychiatric symptoms, while avoiding stimula-tion-induced side effects. The initial effects seen while pro-gramming in movement disorders are usually rapid and only
a few programming sessions are normally necessary during
the months after surgery. In psychiatric disorders the firsteffects are not as noticeable and the experience limited, thusmaking the programing more challenging.
The major risk in the operative procedure consists of intra-
cerebral haemorrhages. Large studies have estimated the riskto be 1–2% with minor intracerebral haemorrhages taken intoaccount ( 4). Implant-related complications may occur, but
they do not normally pose a serious health risk. Stimulation-
induced side effects in DBS vary depending on target areaand may include such symptoms as ocular disturbances, dys-arthria, paresthesia, sweating and hypomania. In favour ofDBS in comparison to lesional surgery, these side effects arereversible and can be removed by altering the stimulationparameters or turning off the neuropacemaker. The stimula-tion does not seem to result in any residual physiological
changes when the treatment is discontinued.

VOL. 70, NO. 7, 483–491http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/08039488.2016.1162846The exact mechanism of action of DBS in psychiatric con-
ditions is not yet fully understood. Animal studies have dem-onstrated axonal activation and neuronal inhibition as an
effect of DBS. Studies investigating the metabolic changes in
depressive patients with DBS in the subcallosal gyrus (SCG)showed a significant decrease in activity ( 5,6). In addition, PET
studies during stimulation in the nucleus accumbens (NA)demonstrated a decrease in metabolic activity of the SCG ( 7).
This lends support to the current theories of pathology inmultiple limbic-cortical systems as a cause for MDD rather
than dysfunction in specific ‘‘mood areas’’ ( 5,8). Hence the
explorations of different target areas.
New indications for DBS are emerging and among these are
a number of various psychiatric disorders. The aim of thisreview is to briefly describe the technique of DBS and to reporton studies published concerning DBS in the treatment of psy-chiatric disorders, with focus on major depressive disorder
(MDD) and OCD. We sought to identify current differences in
target areas, results and complications. Due to the novelty ofthe field and limited number of publications in regard to spe-cific targets, no limitations were made regarding study design,number of participants or primary outcome measurements.
Material and methods
A systematic literature search for publications regarding DBS inpsychiatric conditions was conducted in March 2014 inMEDLINE. The search algorithm included [deep brain stimula-tion] AND [psychiatric], [depression], [obsessive–compulsivedisorder] and [Tourette’s]. Reference lists from relevant studieswere also reviewed. Articles were restricted to English languagepublications and involving humans. No limitations were made
regarding study design or numbers of participants. A total of
54 articles were identified and reviewed in full text. For studiesusing duplicate data, only the study with the most recentresults was included. After this removal a total of 52 studieswere included for this review ( Figure 1 ). Available studies are
shown in Tables 1–3 . The identified studies were analysed
based on DBS target areas, patient characteristics, reported
treatment results, complications and adverse effects of DBS.
Results
The studied target areas for DBS in depression include theSCG ( 6,9–11 ), the NA ( 7), the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP)(12), the ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) ( 13),
the lateral habernula (LH) ( 14) and the supero-lateral branch
of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) ( 15). Targets with results
for OCD include the NA, VC/VS, STN, IC, ITP and bed nucleusof stria terminalis (BNST) ( 8,46–64 ). An anatomic guide to the
main targets can be found in Figure 2 .
Patients in DBS studies for psychiatric disorders
We identified a total of 286 unique patients in 52 studies
treated with DBS for psychiatric indications ( Tables 1–3 ). Most
of these patients were operated for MDD or OCD. Other vari-
ous indications included Tourette’s syndrome ( 20–37 ), primary
anxiety disorder ( 38), alcohol addiction ( 39), anorexia nervosa
(40,41), heroin addiction ( 42,43) and autism with aggression
and self-mutilation ( 44).
Regarding MDD, nine unique studies have been published,
describing a total of 100 patients ( Table 1 ). The NA was tar-
geted in 10 patients ( 7), ITP in one ( 12), the SCG in 67 ( 6,
9–11 ,45), VC/VS in 15 ( 13), the LH in one ( 14) and MFB in seven
(15). There were no major differences regarding inclusion crite-
ria in the seven studies that included more than one patient(6,7,9–11 ,13,15). The patients eligible for DBS treatment were
diagnosed with chronic and therapy-resistant MDD. The dur-
ation ranged from 12–23 years and the mean major depressiveepisode prior to surgery was 5–11 years in the studies where
this was specified. All patients participating in the studies had
tried extensive pharmacological and psychotherapy treatment,and with few exceptions electroconvulsive therapy.
Regarding OCD, 18 unique studies have been published,
describing a total of 112 patients. The VC/VS was targeted in 30
patients ( 46,47), NA in 36 ( 48–53 ), STN in 25 ( 54,55), IC in 12
(56–60 )a n dI T Pi nf i v ep a t i e n t s( 61). Lacking clinical data, add-
itionally four patients received DBS in BNST ( 62). Three patients
with OCD and concomitant Parkinson’s disease were alsoreported ( 63,64). (Table 4 ). Similar to DBS studies in MDD, the
studies regarding OCD did not differ substantially regarding
inclusion criteria. With slight variations patients eligible for DBShad suffered at least 5 years from severe OCD, defined by the
Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) as a minimum
score of 25–28. The presence of therapy-refractory symptomsafter three treatment attempts with selective serotonin-reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs), of which one had to be clomipramine, additive
therapy with a neuroleptic and/or a benzodiazepine and attend-
ance to a minimum of 16–20 cognitive behavioural therapy(CBT) sessions. Generally in the studies these inclusion criteria
were well surpassed with a mean YBOCS of 32–35 and a mean
duration of disease of 22–29 years ( Table 5 ).
Results for DBS in depression
The studies vary in follow-up intervals and tools for evaluation,
thus complicating the comparison. They all have in common
the use of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), with
variations of the version (17, 21, 24 and 28 questions) ( Table
4). Four out of the six studies with more than five participants
used HDRS-17 for evaluation ( 6,9–11 ). The majority of the stud-
ies defined response as a 50% reduction in HDRS from baseline
 Figure 1. The paper selection process.484 M. NAESSTR €OM ET AL.and remission as scores ranging from <10–7 ( 6,7,9–11 ,13). One
study used MADRS as their primary outcome measure, withresponse at 50% score reduction from baseline and remission
at<10 points ( 15).
The SCG was targeted in five publications with a total of
67 patients ( 6,9–11 ,45). Response/remission was achieved in
50/17% at 6 months, 58/17% at 12 months.
VC/VS DBS in 15 patients by Malone et al. resulted in six
responders and three remissions after 6 months and eightout of six at the last evaluation, after a mean time of 2 yearsafter surgery ( 13). A study of 10 patients with NA DBS by
Bewernick et al. reported five responders and three remitters
at 12 months evaluation ( 7). Schlaepfer et al. presented seven
patients with MFB DBS with two responders and four remit-ters after 3–6 months ( 15). Two case reports described remis-
sion after DBS in LH and ITP ( 12,14).
Even though no results have been reported it must be
mentioned that there have been two unpublished random-ized multicentre trials of DBS in SCG and VC/VS. The studies
were, however, discontinued due to inefficacy based on futil-
ity analysis ( 65).
Complications in DBS for depression
Complications related to surgery were few and with minor
health impact. The most common of these adverse effectswere infection and hardware malfunction ( 6,7,9,10,13,15).
Only one minor intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) was reported,with transient hemiparesis and dysarthria ( 15).
Regarding stimulation-related adverse effects, the large
group of patients treated in the SCG, appear to have experi-enced both the fewest and mildest, with nausea as the mostfrequent complaint ( 9,10). The group with the highest fre-
quency of stimulation adverse effects was the 10 patients
receiving DBS in the NA. They reported unwanted symptomssuch as hypomania, agitation and psychosis ( 7). The most
noted adverse effect in MFB was oculomotor disturbanceswith strabismus and blurred vision ( 15). All these side effects
were transient and could be abolished by adjusting thestimulation parameters, thus demonstrating the advantage ofreversibility in DBS.
Two suicides and four attempts occurred during the stud-
ies. However, the authors did not consider these events to berelated to the DBS treatment ( 7,9–11 ).
Reports on neuropsychological effects were scarce. Two
studies reported no significant decline in neuropsychologicalor cognitive functioning ( 9,15). Additionally, two studies that
focused on such impacts of DBS in SCG noted no adverseneuropsychological effects at the final evaluation ( 66,67).
The complete list of surgical- and stimulation-related com-
plications of interest are presented in Table 1 .Table 1. Reports concerning deep brain stimulation for major depressive disorder. Additional publications using data from patients in the selected studies have
not been included.

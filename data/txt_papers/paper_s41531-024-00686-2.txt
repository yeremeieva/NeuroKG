Clinical, cognitive, and atrophy characteristics depending on sex have been previously reported in
Parkinson ’s disease (PD). However, though sex differences in cortical gray matter measures in early
drug naïve patients have been described, little is known about differences in cortical thickness (CTh) asthe disease advances. Our multi-site sample comprised 211 non-demented PD patients (64.45%males; mean age 65.58 ± 8.44 years old; mean disease duration 6.42 ± 5.11 years) and 86 healthycontrols (50% males; mean age 65.49 ± 9.33 years old) with available T1-weighted 3 T MRI data fromfour international research centers. Sex differences in regional mean CTh estimations were analyzedusing generalized linear models. The relation of CTh in regions showing sex differences with age,
disease duration, and age of onset was examined through multiple linear regression. PD males
showed thinner cortex than PD females in six frontal (bilateral caudal middle frontal, bilateral superiorfrontal, left precentral and right pars orbitalis), three parietal (bilateral inferior parietal and leftsupramarginal), and one limbic region (right posterior cingulate). In PD males, lower CTh values in nineout of ten regions were associated with longer disease duration and older age, whereas in PD females,lower CTh was associated with older age but with longer disease duration only in one region. Overall,male patients show a more widespread pattern of reduced CTh compared with female patients.Disease duration seems more relevant to explain reduced CTh in male patients, suggesting worseprognostic over time. Further studies should explore sex-speci ﬁc cortical atrophy trajectories using
large longitudinal multi-site data.
There is a growing interest in the eff ect of sex in neurodegenerative
diseases. In the precision medicine era, sex differences are relevant tothe development of further tailored prevention, diagnosis, and treat-ment strategies
1,2. In this context, epidemiology studies report that
Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is more common in males than females
showing a 1.18 overall male/female prevalence ratio according to themost recent metanalysis
3. Additionally, sex has been spotlighted, in the
translational neuroscience ﬁeld, as a factor with potential in ﬂuence on
different clinical and pathological characteristics of PD4.
Regarding the clinical features of PD, the ﬁndings point to a dis-
tinct pattern depending on sex: a male phenotype characterized byfreezing of gait, camptocormia, dr ooling, worse general cognitive
abilities, greater de ﬁcits than female non-demented patients in execu-
tive functions, and more rapid progression in the severe stage of thedisease; and a female phenotype characterized by postural tremor,frequent falls, dysphagia, gastrointestinal dysfunction, pain, andvisuospatial impairment

Sex also has been considered a de ﬁning feature of neuroimaging
phenotypes of several major brain disorders6. However, despite the rele-
vance of the research topic, the data on sex differences in gray matter
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cortical atrophy measures in PD islimited to a few previous studies. Fi rst, a single-site study from 2016 ana-
lyzed a sample comprised of 43 PD males and 21 PD females with a diseaseduration of 3.7 years on average through a cortical thickness (CTh) vertex-wise approach

compared with female patients in severa l cortical regions, revealing a mainly
parieto-occipital regiona l pattern of sex differences. Subsequent studies have
focused on multicentric MRI data from early drug naïve PD patients of thePPMI cohort
8–10. In early drug naïve PD patients, deformation-based
morphometry (DBM) analyses revealed gray matter atrophy in cortical
regions in both directions (PD males > PD females, and vice versa)8.
Moreover, the authors did not ﬁnd sex differences in CTh parcellations8.I na
subsequent study, we found thinner cortex in PD males compared with PDfemales limited to paracentral and postcentral areas using a vertex-wiseprocedure
9. Last, the most recent study using the PPMI cohort explored a
l a r g es a m p l eo fe a r l yd r u gn a ï v eP Dp a t ients cross-sectionally and a smaller
subsample with two-year follow-up s using vertex-wise CTh and voxel-
based morphometry (VBM)10. The cross-sectional analyses revealed greater
cortical gray matter atrophy mainly in frontal lobe, parietal lobe, andtemporal lobe regions in PD males compared with PD females. The long-itudinal analyses did not show any signi ﬁcant sex difference in changes over
time in those regions that showed se x differences cross-sectionally
10.
One of the main gaps of the previous studies is that they did not explore
the association between regions showing sex differences in gray mattermeasures and relevant variables that inform of the aging process and thedisease course. In this respect, while age contributes to sex differences inregional gray matter cortical reductions in the general population
11,12,a n d
disease duration13,14and the age of onset15have been associated with cortical
gray matter atrophy in PD, their effects on regional sex differences in PDpatients have not been explored.
The overall goal of the current stud y was to investigate sex differences
in cortical gray matter atrophy in a large sample of non-demented PD with a
wide disease duration range. In this regard, multi-site PD MRI datasets arefundamental to sex differences studi es, as a larger sample size protects
against statistical power loss due to subgrouping. Our ﬁrst aim was to
characterize sex differences in non-demented PD in CTh, using regionalmean CTh measures derived from T1-weighted 3 T MRI acquisitions. We
hypothesized that male PD patients would show thinner cortex compared
with female PD patients in several regions. Our second aim was to explorethe age, disease duration, and age of onset effects on CTh in those regionsshowing sex differences.
Results
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics
Parkinson ’s disease females were older than PD males, and PD males had
more years of education than PD females (Table 1). Thus, both variables
were included as covariates in further analyses.
Concerning clinical variables, PD females had a statistically signi ﬁcant
older age of onset than PD males (Table 1). Therefore, it was included as a
covariate when comparing betw een sexes within the PD group.
Regarding global cognitive scores, PD males had statistically sig-
niﬁcantly lower scores than healthy co ntrol (HC) males in Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE, Table 1).
Regarding MRI variables, there were no signi ﬁcant differences in
WMH-hypo volume nor in the presence of high Fazekas scores. Asexpected, the estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) was higher in malesthan in females in both PD and HC groups (Table 1).

(right posterior cingulate) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). There were no
statistically signi ﬁcant differences in the opposite direction. Comparisons
between sexes within the HC group did not reveal any statistically signi ﬁcant
difference.
The supplementary analysis revealed that there were no statistically
signiﬁcant differences between PD males and PD females in the brain
parenchymal fraction (BPF; PD males, M= 0.717, SD= 0.041; PD females,
M= 0.720, SD= 0.048; t= 0.472, P-value = 0.637) and all sex differences
within the PD group (i.e., for the ri g h tm e a nC T ha n dt h et e nr e g i o n a l
estimations) remained statistically signi ﬁcant after including the BPF as an
extra covariate (Supplementary Table 3).
When comparing PD patients with HC by sexes, including age and
years of education as covariates, we found that PD females showed thinnercortex in one temporal (left inferior temporal), three parietal (right inferior
parietal, right paracentral, and right precuneus), and four occipital regions
(bilateral lateral occipital, left lingual, and right fusiform) compared withHC females (Fig. 2and Supplementary Table 1). On the other hand, PD
males compared with HC males showed lower CTh values in the right meanestimation and ﬁve frontal (bilateral caudal mid dle frontal, bilateral superior
frontal, and right precentral), four temporal (bilateral middle temporal, leftinferior temporal, and right entorhinal), six parietal (bilateral inferior par-ietal, bilateral superior parietal, left supramarginal, and right precuneus), sixoccipital (bilateral fusiform, bilateral l ateral occipital, and bilateral lingual),
and two limbic regions (right isthmus and right posterior cingulate). Therewere no statistically signi ﬁcant differences in the opposite direction (Fig. 2
and Supplementary Table 1).
Age, disease duration, and age of onset as explanatory variables
of regional cortical thickness
In PD males, age and disease duration w ere negatively associated with CTh,
for nine out of ten regions, except for one region in which only age wasassociated with CTh (Tables 2and3). Thus, older age together with longer
disease duration was signi ﬁcantly associated with thinner cortex in PD
males in almost all regions showing se x differences. On the other hand, in
PD females, age was negatively associat ed with thinner cortex in eight out of
ten regions, whereas longer disease du ration was associated with thinner
cortex only in one region (Tables 2and3).
Complementary, as expected, the analyses that included age of onset as
an explanatory variable instead of disease duration showed congruentresults, revealing signi ﬁcant associations of older age and younger age of
onset with thinner cortex in nine out of ten regions in male patients, but onlyin one region in female patients (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).Altogether, older age, longer disease duration, and younger age of onset
signiﬁcantly contributed to explaining reduced CTh in PD males in regions
showing sex differences.
Sex differences in subcortical gray matter volume in Parkinson ’s
disease patients
Our supplementary analyses showed higher gray matter volume in the
brainstem, bilateral thalamus, and right amygdala in PD males comparedwith PD females (Supplementary Tabl e 6). After excluding three cases of
male patients displaying extreme val ues for the brainstem and the thalamus
(z-score ≥3), only sex differences for the right amygdala remained sig-
niﬁcant in the PD group, which was observed in the HC group in the same
direction.
Discussion
In this study, the main aim was to analyze sex differences in regionalmean CTh estimations in a large sample of non-demented PD using amulti-site approach. We found that male patients had thinner cortex in
several regions compared with female patients. Furthermore, for those
regions showing a signi ﬁcant group by sex interaction, the pattern of
reduced CTh in patients compared with controls involved more areasin male patients than in female pa tients. Whereas the pattern of
reduced CTh in female patients was more restricted to posterior
regions, the male patients had a more extended pattern of thinnercortical regions, including frontal , parietal, and limbic regions. On the
other hand, aging and disease course -related variables (disease dura-
tion and age of onset) contributed to explaining reduced CTh

study also involved bilateral caudal midd le frontal, bilateral superior frontal,
bilateral inferior parietal, and left supramarginal regions7. However, the
authors analyzed single-site 1.5 T M RI data from 64 PD patients (43 males
and 21 females) and 46 HC (12 males and 34 females). Thus, even though
the effect sizes were not reported, the reduced sizes of the subgroups couldmitigate the statistical power, espe cially for PD females and HC males. It
might partially explain the absence of signi ﬁcant differences in other
comparisons; for example, betw een male patients and controls

more, they did not explore the group by sex interaction, which also limits theinterpretation of the ﬁndings. In this respect, w e found that male patients
had reduced CTh compared with male controls in almost all the regionsshowing sex differences within the PD group (nine out of ten). Moreover, wepreviously guaranteed that there were signi ﬁcant group by sex interactions
for all regions in which sex differences were explored.
Our results showed sex differences in CTh in PD, revealing several
thinner regions in male patients co mpared with female patients. These
ﬁndings contrast with previous results from early drug naïve PD patients
from the PPMI cohort

not show differences in a previous study8. In a subsequent study, we
explored sex differences by applying a CTh vertex-wise approach9.W e
found that male patients showed thinner cortex in small clusters limited toleft postcentral and right precentral areas. However, the comparison
between male patients and controls did not report differences in theseregions
9. Finally, the most recent study exploring early drug naïve patients
from this cohort found more widespread reduced CTh in PD males than PD
females, including frontal, parietal, and temporal areas, using a vertex-wise
approach10. In line with our results, the authors found thinner cortex in the
right precentral and left cingulate areas in PD males compared with PDfemales
10. As a matter of interest, the three early drug naïve PD samples
came from the same time point of the PPMI cohort, and probably thesamples were partially overlapped. Altogether, previous and current ﬁnd-
ings suggest that sex differences are pre sent in early drug naïve PD patients,
showing mainly a more marked pattern of reduced CTh in male patients;this pattern might be more pronounced when the disease duration is longer.These ﬁndings might re ﬂect that the cortical gray matter atrophy trajectories
differ between male and female patients. However, the only longitudinal
exploration to date revealed no signi ﬁcant sex differences in the gray matter
atrophy longitudinal changes in earl y drug naïve PD patients after 2-year
follow-ups analyzing a subgroup of 66 PD males and 31 PD females from the
PPMI cohort
10. Further studies should address if there are sex-speci ﬁcg r a y
matter atrophy trajectories using larger multi-site data and several timepoints, ideally from preclinical stages and with long-term follow-ups.
Lower CTh estimations in PD males compared with PD females were
concentrated mainly on right hemis phere regions in contrast with left
hemisphere regions (i.e., six in the rig ht versus four in the left hemisphere;
see Fig. 1a n dS u p p l e m e n t a r yT a b l e2 ) .I nt h es a m ed i r e c t i o n ,t h eg l o b a l
measure of right mean CTh was lower in PD males than in PD females. One
could argue the existence of a lateralization pattern of cortical atrophy
depending on sex. Interestingly, previous studies have reported pre-dominant left-hemispheric ﬁndings in PD
16–18.T h e n ,o n ec o u l dh y p o t h e s i z e
that male and female patients have similar atrophy rates in some left-hemispheric regions, with a more prono unced right-hemispheric atrophy in
male patients. However, the lower number of ﬁndings in the left hemisphere
does not necessarily imply a right atro phy preponderance in male patients.
In this regard, previous studies focused on sex differences in gray mattermeasures in PD did not support the existence of a lateralized pattern of sexdifferences. Moreover, healthy popu lation-based studies did not report
lateralized sex differences in gray matter measures either
11,19. Furthermore,
the used approach (e.g., regional mean cortical thickness instead of vertex-
wise) and speci ﬁc threshold established for statistical signi ﬁcance could
contribute to a slight lateralization of results in our study.
Next, we explored the relationship between CTh in regions showing
sex differences in PD and aging and d isease course-related variables.
Regarding PD males, older age and longer disease duration weresigniﬁcantly associated with thinner cortex in almost all the regions that
previously showed sex differences. Instead, in PD female patients, older agebut no longer disease duration was associated with thinner cortex in theseregions. In accordance, the same eff ect was observed when introducing age
of onset in the regression analyses. It could be hypothesized that female
patients may show cortical thinning trajectories close to normal aging incertain areas. Whilst male patients show a stepper decline along diseaseduration in these areas. These ﬁndings reinforce the relevance of exploring
longitudinal trajectories to reveal if P D patients display different cortical
atrophy trajectories depending on sex.
Our supplementary analyses showed lower gray matter volume in the
right amygdala in PD females compared with PD males, also observed in theHC group. This pattern of sex differenc es in the amygdala has been reported
previously in population-based studies in adults; however, metanalyticalresults show reduced size effects not supporting a sex dimorphism of this
structure
20. Therefore, this regional ﬁnding may not re ﬂect disease-
dependent sex differences in our sample. The absence of sex differences insubcortical gray matter volumes showing lower estimations in PD malescontrasts with previous ﬁndings
8,9,21. Notably, our study sample is hetero-
geneous for disease duration, contra sting with the de novo PD samples used
in the prior reports8,9,21. Moreover, a recent longitudinal study did not show a
widespread pattern of lower subcortical gray matter volume in male patientsat follow-up, limiting the ﬁndings to the bilateral cerebellum crus (I and II
lobules)
10.
The main strength of the current report was the use of cortical gray
matter MRI data from a large multi-site sample from four international
research centers applying a harmoni zation approach which guarantees
better control of the site effect22. The sampling strategy is relevant since the
female group size in PD samples is frequently smaller in single-site MRIstudies, which does not allow for performing sex differences analyses.Furthermore, prior explorations of sex differences using data from multiple
centers did not control for the multi-site bias, even when combining 1.5 and3 Tesla acquisitions
8,9. The main limitation of the study was that the data was
limited to cross-sectional MRI acquisit ions. In this regard, future research
should address sex differences in corti cal atrophy trajectories using long-
itudinal MRI data from preclinical to advanced stages and with long-termfollow-ups. Moreover, clinical data, b iomarkers of co-pathology, and genetic
variants were not systematically collected in the four research centers, which
limited further analyses focused on t he association of sex with other vari-
ables apart from those explored in this study (i.e., age, disease duration, andage of onset). Incorporating standa rdized protocols may enhance the
characterization of multi-site sample s for research purposes. Future studies
should cover if sex-dependent atrophy t rajectories correlate with clinical
and cognitive outcomes. Besides, fur ther research should address whether
patterns of neurodegeneration vary depending on sex within the previouslydescribed longitudinal clinical subty pes and cross-sectional atrophy sub-
types of the disease
23–27, considering also reported sex differences in genetic
factors in PD28. Another limitation of our s tudy is the absence of a stan-
dardized protocol for neuropsycho logical assessment. For a better char-
acterization of cognitive pro ﬁle in PD multi-site studies, further initiatives
are encouraged to use harmonized protocols29.
Further studies should cover the im pact of cerebrovascular disease and
Alzheimer ’s disease co-pathologies on sex differences in PD. For example,
we have included WMH-hypo volume extracted using FreeSurfer as acontrol variable; however, further s tudies should address the impact of
WMH-hypo/WMH-hyper on the effects of sex in PD using advanced lesion
segmentation techniques (i.e., Bayesian models and deep learningapproaches).
Evidence on sex differences in gray matter atrophy markers is relevant
to developing diagnostic and prognostic approaches in the context of per-
sonalized medicine. Parallel to these advances, the efforts need to focus on
the mechanisms behind the observed di fferences, from the neuroprotective
role of estrogens
30to genetics28. In this sense, there is no established model
about how sex impacts PD. From this perspective, in a recent review, Cerriet al. pointed out three levels in which sex in ﬂuences PD pathophysiologyhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00686-2 Article

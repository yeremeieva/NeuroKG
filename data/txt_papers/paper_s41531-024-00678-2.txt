Postural instability is one of the most disabling motor signs of Parkinson ’s disease (PD) and often underlies
an increased likelihood of falling and loss of independ ence. Current clinical assessments of PD-related
postural instability are based on a retropulsion t est, which introduces human error and only evaluates
reactive balance. There is an unmet need for objectiv e, multi-dimensional assessments of postural
instability that directly re ﬂect activities of daily living in which indivi duals may experience postural instability.
In this study, we trained machine-learning models on in sole plantar pressure data from 111 participants (44
with PD and 67 controls) as they performed simulated st atic and active postural tasks of activities that often
occur during daily living. Models accurately classi ﬁed PD from young controls (area under the curve (AUC)
0.99+/−0.00), PD from age-matched controls (AUC 0.99 +/−0.01), and PD fallers from PD non-fallers
(AUC 0.91 +/−0.08). Utilizing features from both st atic and active postural tasks signi ﬁcantly improved
classi ﬁcation performances, and all tasks were useful for separating PD from controls; however, tasks with
higher postural threats were preferred for separating PD fallers from PD non-fallers.
Postural instability is a cardin al motor symptom of Parkinson ’sd i s e a s e( P D )
and is characterized by de ﬁcits in the control of static, reactive, and proactive
posturing1–3. Postural instability leads to falls, loss of independence, physical
injuries, and immobilization in severe cases4. The underlying pathophy-
siology of PD-related postural i nstability is not well understood5,p o s t u r a l
instability has little or no response to current PD treatments6,7,a n du pt o
90% of people with PD will fall at some stage of the disease progression8,9.
One of the factors contributing to these challenges is a lack of quantitative,objective, and accessible approaches to effectively characterize the multi-
faceted nature of postural instability in individuals with PD.
The clinical gold standard of postural instability assessments is the
retropulsion test, which involves pulling back on an individual ’s shoulders
and visually inspecting how many steps are necessary to regain balance
10.
While well-validated, the retropulsion test is subjective, requires a trainedclinician, and addresses only reactive balance, which is just one aspect ofpostural control
11. Several studies have demonstrated that monitoring the
center of pressure (COP) over a variety of balance tasks is a useful andobjective way to identify altered postural control in PD
12,13, especially in
individuals with PD who have a history of falls14,15. These COP measure-
ments are especially valuable for asse ssing balance tasks involving heigh-
tened postural threat, which is characterized by signi ﬁcant disturbances tothe postural control system, prompting individuals to adjust their posture to
maintain an upright position16. An increase in postural threats can be due to
things such as: (1) removing visual cues while maintaining an uprightstance, (2) changing the support surface from a hard ﬂat surface to a soft,
tilted surface, or (3) removing a traditional base of support by requiring anindividual to stand upright with only one foot on the ground as opposed toboth feet. However, traditional methods to assess COP during a variety ofbalance tasks are not widely available outside of research settings andtherefore are not useful in many clinical or at-home settings.
Monitoring insole plantar pressure
17could be a simple, low-cost, and
accessible way to frequently assess postural control through COP mea-
surements in each foot. However, studies demonstrating that plantarpressure data can be used to identify PD-related postural instability arelimited. In a small feasibility study, plantar pressure was used to identify PD-speciﬁc balance patterns during quiet stance and gait

machine-learning models for detection of PD and PD who have a history ofone or more falls. We hypothesized that utilizing both static and activebalance tasks would improve classi ﬁcation performance between control
and PD subjects. Previous work has also demonstrated that tasks with higher
postural threat help with identifying i ndividuals with PD who are at risk for
falling
14,23–25. We further hypothesized that models would put more weight
on active balance task features to differentiate PD fallers from PD non-fallers.Results
Insole plantar pressure was collected wh ile subjects performed three static
balance tasks (quiet stance eyes open, q uiet stance eyes closed, quiet stance
eyes open on one foot) and three active balance tasks (gait, functional reach,
bending over) (Fig. 1). These data were collected across varying participant
demographics and surface types (Supplementary Table 1). After collectionof insole plantar pressure data, COP-de rived features collected during these
tasks served as input to train ﬁve machine-learning model architectures

Fig. 1 | Machine-learning models were developed to classify PD from young
controls, PD from age-matched controls, and PD fallers from PD non-fallers,
based on features derived from insole plantar pressure. a Plantar pressure was
recorded and used to calculate COP per foot from three static balance tasks and threeactive balance tasks. Positional, dynamic, and frequency domain features were
generated from the COP. The average of each feature and the asymmetry of each
feature across feet were computed. The static task and active task features wereutilized separately and combined to develop the machine-learning classi ﬁer models.
bF-statistic pre- ﬁltering and forward sequential feature selection were used to
identify an optimal subset of features which maximized each model ’sﬁve-fold cross-validation F1 score. Once the subset of features per model was determined, hyper-
parameter tuning over a ﬁve-fold cross-validation was completed. cFrom the tuned
model, the model performance was assessed, and individuals who were misclassi ﬁed
across models were identi ﬁed.dFeatures commonly chosen by feature selection
methods were identi ﬁed, and Shapley analysis was performed for each model to
identify features with the highest Shapley value. Features that appeared in the
common feature set and top Shapley value feature set were analyzed to understand
their underlying biomechanical implications related to PD and individuals with PDwho have a history of falls.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00678-2 Article

between PD subjects and controls (you ng and age-matched), and between
individuals with PD who do and do not have a history of falls (PD fallers andPD non-fallers, respectively). COP-derived features from static and activetasks were used separately and then together. For each classi ﬁcation, the
feature sets were ﬁrst pre- ﬁltered by way of F-statistic feature selection.
Then, forward sequential feature selection with ﬁve distinct machine-
learning model architectures was used to determine an optimal subset offeatures that maximized each model ’s classi ﬁcation performance, measured
by the ﬁve-fold cross-validation F1 score. After determining the optimal
feature subset, the hyperparameters of each model were tuned, and theperformance metrics of each model were determined using a ﬁve-fold cross-
validation. Complete model performance results and all performancemetrics are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 –6.

subjects
For comparisons of COP between PD subjects and young controls (Fig. 2a)
and between PD subjects and age-matched controls (Fig. 2b), there was no
effect signi ﬁcant effect of model type on classi ﬁcation. Additionally, models
trained on only static or only active tasks performed similarly across allmetrics. In contrast, the models trained on static +active task features****

(young controls: accuracy p< 0.001, precision p< 0.001, f1 p< 0.001, kappa
p< 0.001; age-matched controls: accuracy p< 0.001, recall p< 0.001, f1
p< 0.001, kappa p< 0.001). Models trained on features from the static
+active tasks that best classi ﬁed PD from young control groups, based on
ﬁve-fold cross-validation performan ces, were the support vector machine,
K-nearest neighbors, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes models (AUC of 0.99 +/−
0.00 [standard error mean]; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 4). For
classi ﬁcation between PD and age-matched control groups trained on static
+active task features, again based on ﬁve-fold cross-validation perfor-
mances, the K-nearest neighbors model performed the best (AUC of 0.99 +/
−0.01 standard error mean; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 5).
COP-derived feature differences between PD fallers and non-
fallers
When comparing PD fallers with non-fallers, there was no signi ﬁcant effect
on model type for any performance metrics. There was a marginalimprovement in classi ﬁcation performance with models trained on active
task features compared to static task features but with no signi ﬁcantdifference. Similarly, there was a marginal improvement in classi ﬁcation
performance for models trained on static +active task features compared to
only static task features or only active task features, but no signi ﬁcant dif-
ferences (Fig. 2c). The model that best classi ﬁed between PD faller and PD
non-faller groups, based on ﬁve-fold cross-validation performances, was the
Gaussian Naïve Bayes model. This model achieved an AUC of 0.93 +/−
0.04 (standard error mean) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 6).
Common features
When comparing data from individuals with PD and age-matched controls,
models trained on the static task shared 35 common features, derived mostlyfrom the quiet stance with eyes open task and averaging foot COP data (Fig.3a and Supplementary Fig. 8a). For models trained on the active task, 26
features were common with most from the bending-over task and an evensplit between average and asymmetric COP features. Combining static and
active task features resulted in 88 common features, mostly from static
balance tasks, and predominantly average features. Among the commonfeatures, 7 unique features also had top Shapley values.
For data collected between PD fallers and PD non-fallers, models
trained on the static task had nine com mon features, derived primarily from
the quiet stance eyes closed task and from asymmetric COP foot metrics(Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 8b). For models trained on active task
features, there were 10 common features, derived mostly from the gait task.F o rm o d e l st r a i n e do ns t a t i c +active task features, there were 17 common
features, again derived primarily from the gait task. Out of the commonfeatures for static, active, and static +active models, 9 unique top Shapley
features were identi ﬁed.
Key features
For models comparing individuals with PD and age-matched controls, 7
features that were common across static, active, and static +active tasks also
appeared as top Shapley features in a model (Fig. 4aa n dT a b l e 1). Four were
from static balance task features (3 e yes open, 1 one foot) and three were
features from active balance tasks (2 bend over, 1 functional reach). Nofeatures appeared from gait tasks. Five were positional measures, one was adynamic measure, and one was a frequency measure (SupplementaryFig. 11a).
Additionally, for models trained to differentiate PD fallers from non-
fallers, 9 features that were common across static, active, and static +active
tasks models also appeared as top Shapley features in a model (Fig. 4ba n d
Table 1). Five were static balance task features (4 eyes closed, 1 one foot), and
four were from active balance tasks (3 gaits, 1 bend over). No featuresappeared from a quiet stance eyes open or from functional reach. Further,ﬁve were dynamic features and four were frequency features. There were no
positional features. Lastly, four of the features were average features and ﬁve
were asymmetric features (Supplementary Fig. 11b).
Discussion
This study demonstrates the utility of insole plantar pressure recordingsduring simulated daily living activities to differentiate between individuals
with PD and control subjects (young and age-matched), as well as betweenPD fallers and PD non-fallers. Feature selection and Shapley analysis of themachine-learning models fu rther enabled the identi ﬁcation of speci ﬁct a s k s
(static and active), COP trajectories ( p o s i t i o n ,d y n a m i c ,a n df r e q u e n c y ) ,a n d
consistency of COP between feet (average and asymmetry) that best dif-ferentiated between groups.
This study investigated binary classi ﬁcation models leveraging insole
pressure data from static and active tas ks to differentiate PD subjects from
young and age-matched control groups. The classi ﬁcations assessed in this
study achieved high performance (with F1 scores greater than 97% for all
models trained on static +active features). Additionally, three models clas-
sifying PD from young controls (sup port vector machine, K-nearest
neighbors, and Gaussian Naïve Bay es) demonstrated perfect classi ﬁcation
(100% accurate) over a ﬁve-fold cross-validation. Together, these data

simulated tasks that are often performed as part of daily living.
Previous studies that have levera ged machine-learning models to
classify PD and control groups have focused primarily on one task,
including quiet stance (86% accuracy)26or gait (95% accuracy)27.T h e
improved performance achieved by static +a c t i v et a s k sm o d e l si nt h i ss t u d y
likely stems from choosing tasks th at sample non-redundant aspects of
postural control. This ﬁnding emphasizes the diff erences in the manifes-
tation of postural control dysfuncti on amongst individuals with PD and
demonstrates the clinical need to quantify a variety of balance assessments tofully capture the high dimensionality of PD-related postural instability.
In conjunction with combining static +a c t i v et a s k si nt h em o d e l s ,t h e
use of insole plantar pressure from each foot enabled assessment of COPasymmetry, which proved helpful in differentiating PD fallers from PD non-fallers. In this study, the KNN model t rained on insole plantar pressure
features from both static and active tasks, achieved 91% accuracy, 93%
precision, and 80% recall. A previous study using a force plate to capture
COP metrics during static balance tasks and a decision tree model hadperformance results of 88% accura cy, 75% precision, and 57% recall
24.O t h e r
studies have investigated COP charac teristics to differentiate betweencontrols, PD non-fallers, and PD fallers, but did not use insole plantar
pressure sensors, machine-learning algo rithms, or investigate the effect of
b a l a n c et a s kt y p eo nc l a s s i ﬁcation23,25.
This study also investigated the effect of task type on model classi ﬁ-
cation performance between PD fallers and PD non-fallers. Models usingactive task features showed slightly better performance than those usingstatic task features, and models trained on both static +active features
showed the highest performance. Abnormalities in postural control for PDfallers have been shown to be mor e evident during active tasks
14and static
tasks with induced postural threat28, explaining why models using active
tasks performed better, and static +active task models had the best classi-
ﬁcation performance. These ﬁndings highlight the importance of using a
variety of balance assessments to fully capture the high dimensionality ofpostural instability, especially tasks w ith higher postural threat to assess fall
risk in PD.
Using common feature identi ﬁcation and Shapley analysis, the models
identi ﬁed seven key features that had a high marginal contribution to
classifying subjects with PD from age -matched controls. While these fea-
tures were biomechanically relevant, classi ﬁcation performance was higher
